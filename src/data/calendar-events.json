    "description": "Wow gang, it has been a while! The meetup next week is for general planning for 2026 and no specific topics are planned.\n\nThe good news is that I finally found reliable funding sources and will be able to start regular hosting of our Python events again.\n\nI will be teaching my entomology class again in the fall at Virginia Western Community College in Roanoke. They also have a couple of great computer lab spaces we can used to host a hybrid Python meetup. This spring we can do introduction to git versioning and venv like we always do, and add some in person lab practice. I plan to deploy an array of Raspberry Pis for the lab.\n\nIf you have specific Python modules that you would like to learn about, please send me a note. The foundation wants to promote real world usage. Once you get past the language basics there are a lot of very useful packages that make your professional work easier.\n\nFun times ahead!\nMicah",

    "description": "***Industry 4.0 and digital transformation is causing a shift in the risk model for industrial security as the data produced by operations becomes as valuable (or more valuable) than the actual operations. An example could be an electric utility that discounts the cost of electricity as incentive to get permission to use some (or all) of the operations and usage data.***\n\n***The value of the electrons is essentially fixed where the value of the operational data is virtually unlimited. This creates an opportunity for additional profit potential for creation and sale of data products in addition to the electric power to the customer.***\n\n***As the organizational profit center shifts to include operational assets as well as operational data and its path outside of the operational environment, so does the risk.***\n\n***In this presentation, learn how to secure your modern/future industrial organization from the industrial process to the operational data products and beyond.***\n\n***[REGISTER NOW](https://events.zoom.us/ev/Asd2TohPY74emdRXtPuQzLN0JeMyrWj_ld4Hw2lMIbp0tp1Ik0mB~ArF0cPouLtJ73Dx-SRMl7Z7Dc3p8D8z719jw2yo-chkrKGWTF-nlzQ_QRLdSx2-ULCRhi59ML14ywNKoqk72zKamBA)***\n\n***[https://events.zoom.us/ev/Asd2TohPY74emdRXtPuQzLN0JeMyrWj_ld4Hw2lMIbp0tp1Ik0mB~ArF0cPouLtJ73Dx-SRMl7Z7Dc3p8D8z719jw2yo-chkrKGWTF-nlzQ_QRLdSx2-ULCRhi59ML14ywNKoqk72zKamBA](https://events.zoom.us/ev/Asd2TohPY74emdRXtPuQzLN0JeMyrWj_ld4Hw2lMIbp0tp1Ik0mB~ArF0cPouLtJ73Dx-SRMl7Z7Dc3p8D8z719jw2yo-chkrKGWTF-nlzQ_QRLdSx2-ULCRhi59ML14ywNKoqk72zKamBA)***\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBecoming a paid member is quick and easy (and helps us keep offering these educational opportunities!).

    "description": "Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET\nby Brandon Atkinson\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.\n\nBio:\nBrandon Atkinson is a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field. He has authored books, been a Microsoft MVP (in SharePoint!), and holds a patent for CI/CD pipelines. He loves tinkering with code, and spends his time with his family in Richmond, VA.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely.
