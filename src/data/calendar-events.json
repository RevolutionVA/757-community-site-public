In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: https://discord.gg/nUSHDN2J2T\nOnce in the Discord Server, go to the voice chat named \"Meeting Room\"\n\nAgenda:\n6:30 PM: Doors open\n7:00 PM: Main Event\n8:00 PM Questions and Social Time",
