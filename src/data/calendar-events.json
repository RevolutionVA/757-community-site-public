    "description": "# Robots, Rails, Bytes and Risk\n\nRobotic warehousing may not be the first thing we think of when discussing industrial control systems. However, modern automated warehousing is a myriad of different IT and OT technologies that combine to create a robust business solution at an immense scale. In this case study discussion, cyber security veteran Brent Huston will discuss how information security frameworks, technical analysis, machine learning and proper application of risk management techniques led to a successful implementation.\n\nWe’ll discuss how the project unfolded, some of the significant challenges and lessons learned. We’ll also discuss what it sounds like when robots smash into each other at high speeds and how difficult root cause analysis can be in a complex environment.\n\n**[CLICK HERE TO REGISTER](https://events.zoom.us/ev/ArygFuY9b0KE34GwhcfaVY6ZGK1lo52PKiRsstNFwN2hfqQErY0u~AofaED3WiR4eYR6AzAVoTI8Ul20Hv7woLvszw-k1HpuJdYcK3kU2oFhqqcfvTJU4nLeOuah4ubJTjlPLKw0g3e3dPg)**\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBecoming a paid member is quick and easy \\(and helps us keep offering these educational opportunities\\!\\)\\.

Instead, they show how embracing fear can be the key to achieving audacious goals. Whether you’re launching a startup, stepping into leadership, making a career pivot or life-changing decision, raising the next generation, or tackling a personal challenge that seems insurmountable, the lesson is clear: the greatest breakthroughs happen when you do it scared. 🚀\n\nAudiences will rethink fear, reframe risk, and take bold steps toward their biggest goals.\n\nParticipate in the Career and Vendor Expo, daily from 5:00 - 6:30 pm.

A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.\n\nPeople who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.\n\nSalaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.\n\n**The course is open to the public.**\n[https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained](https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained)",

A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.\n\nPeople who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.\n\nSalaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.\n\n**The course is open to the public.**\n[https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained](https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained)",
