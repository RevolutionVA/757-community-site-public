    "description": "By Kenn Jensen\nVisit our [Eventbrite Page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/issa-hr-presents-ai-poisoning-tickets-1983643092889) to **RSVP**\n\nWith over 35 years of professional experience in the IT domain, Kens background spans programming, database and web development, call center technology and consulting, emergency services management solutions, automation, as well as enterprise security web filtering and enterprise network discovery and monitoring. By day, Ken works as a senior infrastructure engineer. By night, OSINT for good and AI experimenting and red teaming.\n\nThis talk breaks down LLM data poisoning in plain English, explaining how attackers can intentionally introduce misleading or malicious data during training or fine-tuning so a model learns the wrong patterns. You’ll see how even small amounts of manipulated data can influence outputs, create blind spots, or quietly weaken the reliability of AI-driven tools that organizations depend on every day.\nWe’ll walk through the most common entry points where poisoning can occur, including third-party datasets, user-generated inputs, and automated data pipelines. The session will also highlight real-world implications for security teams, from trust erosion and decision risk to operational and compliance concerns. Attendees will leave with a practical understanding of the guardrails organizations use to reduce risk, including data validation practices, monitoring strategies, and governance approaches that help keep AI systems trustworthy and resilient.",

Complex measures get duplicated across models, tweaked slightly, and inevitably drift out of sync. Calculation groups helped, but they came with their own complexity and limitations. This session takes you from zero to productive with User-Defined Functions. Introduced in September 2025, UDFs let you write reusable, parameterized functions in DAX for the first time and DAX Lib (daxlib.org) gives you 30+ community-built function packages to import and use immediately. This session walks through UDF fundamentals, live imports from DAX Lib, and practical examples of replacing duplicated measure logic with clean, maintainable function calls.",

In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: https://discord.gg/nUSHDN2J2T\nOnce in the Discord Server, go to the voice chat named \"Meeting Room\"\n\nAgenda:\n6:30 PM: Doors open\n7:00 PM: Main Event\n8:00 PM Questions and Social Time",
