    "description": "# **The AI-native startup - Scaling without headcount**\n\n​**How founders are achieving 10x output with tiny teams — and how you can too.**\n\n​Startups today look nothing like startups from five years ago. With AI as the new force multiplier, small teams are building faster, operating leaner, and scaling without adding headcount. This session breaks down the *practical tools, workflows, and strategies* that modern founders are using to turn themselves into AI-powered organizations.\n\n​Join **Andrew Stafford** and **Charlie O’Brien** for a tactical walkthrough designed for founders, builders, creators, and operators.\n\n# ​**🔍 What You’ll Learn**\n\n​**The new unit of startup economics**\nWhy 1 person + AI now equals the output of a traditional 10-person team.\n\n​**The 30-second skill every founder needs: Real prompt engineering**\nUse the R.C.T.F. framework (Role, Context, Task, Format) to turn AI into a reliable digital employee.\n\n​**Coding for everyone — from no-code to advanced devs**\nHow tools like **Lovable**, **[Vly.ai](http://vly.ai/)**, **Cursor**, and **Copilot** cut build time by 30–50%.\n\n​**Marketing & content workflows that actually work**\nResearch with **Perplexity**, branding with **Midjourney/Ideogram**, SEO with **Claude**, and lead enrichment with **Clay + Smartlead**.\n\n​**Automation & agents: The next frontier**\nHow “AI staff” can schedule tasks, update CRMs, analyze emails, build components, and execute multi-step workflows autonomously.\n\n​**Guardrails & best practices**\nAvoid hallucinations, protect your data, and keep your content authentic.\n​You’ll leave with a **Monday Morning Checklist** — a simple, practical set of actions to start automating your business this week.\n\n# ​**🎙️ Your Speakers**\n\n## ​**Andrew Stafford**\n\n​Co-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads chapter.\n​25 years across two startups, Amazon, NASA, and major enterprise consulting.\n\n## ​**Charlie O’Brien**\n\n​Founder of LOGENTIQ • Sr. Product & Operations Manager at 757 Collab.\n​Helps founders turn unclear goals into clear, delegate-ready AI action plans.\n\n# ​**Who should attend?**\n\n​Founders\n​Small business owners\n​Startup teams\n​Developers & no-coders\n​Anyone wanting to scale without adding overhead\n\n# ​**Why this matters**\n\n​We are in a moment similar to the invention of the camera:\n​the basic work — emails, code, research, admin — has become cheap and fast.\n​Your value now is your *taste*, your *strategy*, and your ability to orchestrate AI tools.\n​This event shows you exactly how to do that.\n\n\\- \\- \\-\n\n**FAQs**\n\n* ​​​**Is there free parking in the area?**\nYes.

    "description": "## *(CS)²AI Online™ Replay: Navigating Vulnerability Disclosures in an ICS Environment, a BADALLOC Case Study*\n\nBased on a real world event, this forum will share their personal thoughts and experiences when a supplier discovered and disclosed a vulnerability within an operating system (RTOS). We will explore the evaluation from initial RTOS risk rating to OEM evaluation techniques and messaging of recommendation to end ICS users. We will review evaluation of a vulnerability with no known exploits and discuss how tomorrow's threat landscape is going to require deep and detailed forensics, with a strong vendor/OEM partnership to provide guidance to end-users.\n\nWith the increasing connectivity of industrial systems comes the benefits of productivity, operational efficiency and process control. This connectivity also creates potential opportunity for cyber criminals to gain access to critical infrastructure systems and industrial control systems (ICS).\n\nSafeguards against this increasing threat landscape include people, process and technical controls to mitigate and balance the risk against reliability, availability and maintainability of the asset. A key tenant to this equation is vulnerability / incident response for the ICS environment where “patching” is not as common as IT systems and at times, not an immediate option for technical or procedural reasons.\n\n***[REGISTER NOW](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AiYL8nPFWAyGFPmRIEBepzX0mD2dud_FOhrL-h3VZ0mG0HLszmH1~ArNZkPZ5tMKgvN3JjD2HXXkwSiilttf42NDZO2nuvJ_fATA_2uUgXA_BpVp9I0HiC9uJyBo3OmN3Gqc3i1j1dfwCSw)***\n\n***[https://events.zoom.us/ev/AiYL8nPFWAyGFPmRIEBepzX0mD2dud_FOhrL-h3VZ0mG0HLszmH1~ArNZkPZ5tMKgvN3JjD2HXXkwSiilttf42NDZO2nuvJ_fATA_2uUgXA_BpVp9I0HiC9uJyBo3OmN3Gqc3i1j1dfwCSw](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AiYL8nPFWAyGFPmRIEBepzX0mD2dud_FOhrL-h3VZ0mG0HLszmH1~ArNZkPZ5tMKgvN3JjD2HXXkwSiilttf42NDZO2nuvJ_fATA_2uUgXA_BpVp9I0HiC9uJyBo3OmN3Gqc3i1j1dfwCSw)***\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBecoming a paid member is quick and easy (and helps us keep offering these educational opportunities!).

    "description": "Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET\nby Brandon Atkinson\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.\n\nBio:\nBrandon Atkinson is a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field. He has authored books, been a Microsoft MVP (in SharePoint!), and holds a patent for CI/CD pipelines. He loves tinkering with code, and spends his time with his family in Richmond, VA.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely.
