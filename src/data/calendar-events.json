    "description": "## Supercharge Your Coding with AI: A Hands-on Intro to Cursor\n\nReady to see how Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize your coding workflow? Join us for an interactive workshop on **Cursor**, the AI-powered IDE built for speed and efficiency. We'll go from setup to deploying a simple app and game, all while learning the powerful features that make Cursor a game-changer.\nThis session is all about practical, hands-on learning. We'll show you how to leverage AI to code faster, debug smarter, and manage your projects with ease.\n\n***\n\n### What We'll Cover 🚀\n\n* **Meet Cursor:** We'll start with a tour of the Cursor interface, showing you how it combines the familiarity of VS Code with groundbreaking AI capabilities.\n* **AI-Assisted Game Dev:** Together, we'll build a small, classic game (like Snake or Pong) from scratch. You'll see firsthand how Cursor's AI can generate code, suggest logic, and accelerate development.\n* **Building a Simple App:** Next, we'll create a practical application, like a to-do list or a basic weather app, using AI to handle boilerplate code and implement features.\n* **Mastering Your Workflow:** We'll show you how to connect Cursor to your **GitHub** account for seamless version control. You'll also learn how to use **Cursor's \"Rules\"** to provide custom context for the AI and get more accurate suggestions.\n* **Learn to Prompt like a Pro:** We'll cover prompt engineering for complex projects and workflows and how to create a proper product requirement document and development checklist to keep track of each step.\n* **Clone a Site with Firecrawl:** Lastly, we'll use Firecrawl MCP to clone nearly any website.\n* **Q&A and Networking:** Got questions? We'll have plenty of time to answer them and for you to connect with other developers exploring the future of coding.\n\n***\n\n### Who Should Attend?\n\nThis meetup is for any anyone who wants to learn how to integrate AI into their coding process. Whether you're a student, a professional developer, vibe coder, or a hobbyist, you'll leave with practical skills you can apply to your own projects.\n\n***\n\n### What to Bring 💻\n\nTo follow along with the hands-on exercises, please bring a laptop with **Cursor** already installed. You can download it for free from [cursor.](https://cursor.sh/)com Also, please have a **GitHub** account created.\nCome join us and discover how to build software faster and more intelligently than ever before!\n\nWe also have a Discord server to chat with others about AI: https://discord.gg/pMpdNHJDEJ **<- The slides for the presentation will also be posted in here**",

    "description": "E2E tests, regression tests, or acceptance tests, no matter what you call them, generally involve manual testing, or writing a suite of automated tests that can become brittle over time and require a lot of maintenance. But what if it didn't need to be this way. What if we could just write some plain english tests that simply state what we want to test, and not worry about page structure, XPaths, etc. We can!\n\nIn this talk we'll look at using an open-source project called Skyvern, coupled with Azure OpenAI to run automated E2E tests only using natural language prompts. Skyvern automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. Combined with the ease of Azure OpenAI, we can quickly build automated testing solutions that can give time back to engineers, and make testing easier and more complete.\n\nWe'll take a look at the parts of this solution, and walk through a simple build that can test any website and report back on its findings.",
