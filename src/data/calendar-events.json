    "description": "**IN PERSON MEETING!!!!!**\nAs SaaS platforms grow through acquisitions, identity data often becomes fragmented across multiple databases and user stores, leading to inconsistent access controls, operational complexity, and security risk. This session presents a real-world case study of consolidating authentication and authorization into a centralized, SQL Server–backed identity platform used across multiple products.\n\nThe solution combined OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 with a central identity database, token-time claim enrichment, and event-driven replication to maintain data consistency while supporting near-zero-downtime migrations. The talk focuses on how SQL Server was used to model users, roles, and permissions; support reliable change propagation; and enable auditing, deprovisioning, and session management at scale.\n\nAttendees will learn practical lessons around schema design, transactional consistency, asynchronous replication, and operational monitoring for identity data. The techniques discussed apply broadly to any system where correctness, availability, and security depend on a well-designed and highly reliable SQL Server data layer.",

In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
