    "description": "Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET\nby Brandon Atkinson\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.\n\nBio:\nBrandon Atkinson is a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field. He has authored books, been a Microsoft MVP (in SharePoint!), and holds a patent for CI/CD pipelines. He loves tinkering with code, and spends his time with his family in Richmond, VA.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely.

    "description": "Kotlin has emerged as a compelling choice for both Android and backend development, offering a modern language with strong null-safety, concise syntax, and excellent interoperability with Java. In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
