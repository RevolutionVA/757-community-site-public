    "description": "Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET\nby Brandon Atkinson\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.\n\nBio:\nBrandon Atkinson is a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field. He has authored books, been a Microsoft MVP (in SharePoint!), and holds a patent for CI/CD pipelines. He loves tinkering with code, and spends his time with his family in Richmond, VA.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely.

    "description": "**From single prompts to coordinated AI teams**\n\nAI agents are moving beyond simple chatbots. In this talk, you will see how multi-agent systems work together to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. Using CrewAI as the framework, we will explore practical patterns that scale from experiments to real production use cases across engineering, operations, and knowledge work.\n\nThis session blends concepts with live examples so attendees leave with both understanding and inspiration.\n\n**🔍 What you’ll learn**\n\n* What multi-agent systems are and why they matter now\n* Core agent roles such as planners, executors, reviewers, and coordinators\n* How CrewAI structures collaboration between agents\n* Practical demos that show agents working together on real problems\n* How the same agent setup can be adapted for resumes, sales workflows, ops automation, and internal tooling\n* Where multi-agent systems break down and how to design around common pitfalls\n\n**🎙️ Your speaker**\n**[Tim Masterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-masterson-a202574/)**\n\nPrincipal Architect of Streaming at Paramount+ and Pluto TV\n\nTim leads large-scale distributed systems powering millions of users across major streaming platforms. He brings deep experience in system architecture, AI-assisted workflows, and production-grade engineering. His focus is not hype, but how emerging AI patterns actually work when reliability, scale, and teams matter.\n\n**👥 Who should attend?**\n\n* Software engineers and architects\n* Product managers and technical founders\n* Data, ML, and AI practitioners\n* Consultants and automation builders\n* Students and job seekers curious about agent-based systems\n* Anyone exploring how AI moves from demos to durable systems\n\nNo prior CrewAI experience required.\n\n**💡 Why this matters**\nSingle-prompt AI tools are reaching their limits. The next wave of useful AI comes from systems where multiple agents collaborate, critique, and adapt. Understanding how to design and reason about these systems now puts you ahead of where AI-powered products and workflows are heading.\n\nIf you want to build AI that feels less like a tool and more like a capable team, this session is for you.\n\n**ℹ️ Other bits of info & FAQs**\nIs there free parking in the area?\nYes.

    "description": "Kotlin has emerged as a compelling choice for both Android and backend development, offering a modern language with strong null-safety, concise syntax, and excellent interoperability with Java. In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
