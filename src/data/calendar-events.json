    "description": "Title: Groovy for fun and profit\nby Sujith Paul\n\nAbstract: Java has a (perhaps unfair) reputation of being a rigid, verbose and conservative programming language. After all, it doesn‚Äôt seem well suited to writing scripts, experimenting with new APIs, spinning up a quick proof of concept or creating expressive Domain-Specific Languages. That is exactly the space where Groovy excels. Inspired by Python, Ruby and SmallTalk, Groovy is a multi-faceted language for the JVM that aims to provide a Java-like feel and syntax, but with added productivity features.\n\nIn this talk we will go over some of those powerful features of Groovy. We will also explore practical ways of using Groovy to improve your developer experience in your day to day work. Whether you are an experienced Java developer or complete newbie, I am sure you will find a few valuable takeaways from this session.\n\nBio: Sujith Paul is a Lead Consultant at Terazo, responsible for the architecture, design and delivery of software solutions on client engagements. His preferred tools of the trade are Java, Spring, Go, AWS, Docker and Terraform. His previous experience includes cloud migration, modernizing enterprise applications and agile transformations. He values craftsmanship, robustness and minimalism.\n\nAway from the computer, Sujith enjoys live music, craft beer and being out in the nature walking or biking.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely. For those attending in person, we will be at the Williamsburg Regional Library, Conference Room B.\nFor online access, the Zoom info is:\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/2562166096?omn=88235279595\nMeeting ID: 256 216 6096\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nUpcoming schedule:\n\nAugust 13, 6:00 PM - Social Event\n\nSeptember 10, 6:30 PM - Williamsburg Library, Conference Room B\nTimothy Stone will discuss Git Commitizenship.\n\nOctober 8, 6:00 PM - Social Event\n\nNovember 12, 6:30 PM - Williamsburg Library, Conference Room B.\nPaul Doolittle will present on python in Excel.\n\nDecember 10, 6:00 PM - Social Event.\n\nJanuary 14, 2026, 6:30 PM - Williamsburg Library\nBrandon Atkinson will present Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET.",

A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.\n\nPeople who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.\n\nSalaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.\n\n**The course is open to the public.**\n[https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained](https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained)",

However, not all commits\nor commit messages are created equal. As more data professionals are required or expected to use source control within a continuous integration or deployment solution, a lack of good information is reducing the efficacy and usefulness of commit messages.\nIn this session we will explore the source control system git, what makes a commit and what a commit message is for.\nWe will also learn what makes a good, and a bad, commit message and how to automatically link commit messages to User Stories and release notes.\n\n**Traci Sewell**\n\n**When the firehose causes the burnout**\n**How Do we create a firebreak?**\n\nBurnout is complex, and as it is unique to every person, it can be difficult to define and identify. Let me help you with that.\nOver the past few years burnout has become commonly mentioned in conversations about work life balance, about work from home, about hybrid working, about returning to the office.\nAs is often the case when a newer issue becomes a commonly used buzzword, it's true definition and potential causes have become watered down. Even the description of the recognized symptoms, prevention and treatments has become diluted. The realities of dealing with burnout, both in the workplace and in our personal lives, have been lost in the smoke.\nIn this session we will be reminded of what burnout actually looks like, how it is correctly defined, and how we can avoid some of the triggers.\nI will share my professional experiences with a variety of different symptoms and issues and introduce you to some of the approaches that I encourage people to use.\nYou will leave this session having added tools to your toolbox that are relatively straightforward, hopefully memorable, and generic enough that they will apply to the majority of us.",
