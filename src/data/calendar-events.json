    "description": "**IN PERSON MEETING!!!!!**\nAs SaaS platforms grow through acquisitions, identity data often becomes fragmented across multiple databases and user stores, leading to inconsistent access controls, operational complexity, and security risk. This session presents a real-world case study of consolidating authentication and authorization into a centralized, SQL Server–backed identity platform used across multiple products.\n\nThe solution combined OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 with a central identity database, token-time claim enrichment, and event-driven replication to maintain data consistency while supporting near-zero-downtime migrations. The talk focuses on how SQL Server was used to model users, roles, and permissions; support reliable change propagation; and enable auditing, deprovisioning, and session management at scale.\n\nAttendees will learn practical lessons around schema design, transactional consistency, asynchronous replication, and operational monitoring for identity data. The techniques discussed apply broadly to any system where correctness, availability, and security depend on a well-designed and highly reliable SQL Server data layer.",

    "description": "## **Using AI to Think Like a Successful Entrepreneur**\n\n*An AI-powered ideation, research, and validation workshop*\n\nBuilding ideas is easy. Proving they matter is hard.\n\nThis hands-on workshop is designed to help you use AI as a thinking partner to move faster from vague ideas to clearer, validated directions. Instead of guessing or relying on gut instinct alone, you will learn practical ways to use AI to challenge assumptions, explore markets, and pressure-test ideas before you invest too much time or energy.\nThis session focuses on how founders, builders, and teams can use AI to think more clearly, ask better questions, and make more informed decisions. No hype. No pitch decks. Just practical frameworks you can apply right away.\n\n**🔍 What you’ll learn**\n\n* How to use AI to generate and refine early-stage ideas\n* Turning assumptions into research questions instead of guesses\n* Exploring customer and market perspectives with AI support\n* Simple validation techniques you can use immediately\n* How to move from intuition-driven thinking to evidence-informed decisions\n\nThis is not about memorizing prompts or chasing tools. It is about learning how to think better with AI in the loop.\n\n**🧠 Your facilitators**\n**[Andrew Stafford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theandrewstafford/)** is a Fractional Chief AI Officer and Director of Technology and Global Alliances at The AI Collective. He works with executive teams to establish clear ownership of AI decisions, focus on real ROI, and avoid unnecessary risk, tool sprawl, and hype-driven strategy.\n\n**[Ted Patterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedjpatterson/)** is a Product and GTM Engineer at Reelist and a founding leader of The AI Collective Hampton Roads. With nearly 20 years of experience across product, research, design, and systems, he focuses on turning complex ideas into testable hypotheses, clear narratives, and practical next steps.\n\nTogether, Andrew and Ted will guide you through an end-to-end ideation, research, and validation flow that blends strategic thinking with hands-on experimentation.\n\n**👥 Who should attend?**\n\n* Founders and early-stage startup teams\n* Product managers, designers, and engineers\n* No-code and automation builders\n* Researchers and analysts\n* Students and career switchers exploring entrepreneurship\n* Anyone curious about using AI to think more clearly about ideas and markets\n\nNo prior AI experience required.\n\n**⚡ Why this matters**\nAI is changing how ideas are formed, tested, and funded. The real advantage is not knowing more tools. It is knowing how to ask better questions, challenge assumptions earlier, and validate faster.\nThis session is about building that muscle.\n\n**ℹ️ FAQs**\n**Is there free parking?**\nYes. There is plenty of free parking available on the ECPI University campus.\n\n**Is this event free?**\nYes. Space is limited, so please RSVP and cancel if your plans change.\n\n**Will food or drinks be provided?**\nLight snacks and drinks will be available.\n\n**🤝 Organizers & partners**\n**​**\n**Organizers**\n[The AI Collective Hampton Roads](https://linktr.ee/aicollectivehr)\n\n**​Platinum partners**\n[TechArk](https://gotechark.com/)\n[Regent University](https://www.regent.edu/)\n[ECPI University](https://www.ecpi.edu/)\n\n**​Silver partners**\n[TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/)\n[Assembly](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)\n\n**​Space partner**\n[757 Collab](https://757collab.org/)\n[The Hive by Virginia Beach](https://yesvirginiabeach.com/the-hive)\n[NSU Innovation Center](https://www.nsu.edu/Academics/Research/Foundations-and-Centers-of-Excellence/NSU-Innovation-Center)\n\n**🌍 ​Our parent org**\n[The AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/) is a global non-profit community uniting 150,000+ pioneers – founders, researchers, operators, and investors – exploring the frontier of AI in major tech hubs worldwide.

    "description": "Kotlin has emerged as a compelling choice for both Android and backend development, offering a modern language with strong null-safety, concise syntax, and excellent interoperability with Java. In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
