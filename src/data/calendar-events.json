    "description": "# From Intelligence to Authority: Securing AI in 2026\n\n*Why AI makes security architecture more important, not less.*\nThis is a **live, digital-only event** focused on how AI is reshaping cybersecurity, identity, and enterprise architecture. No in-person attendance. Join from anywhere.\nAs AI systems become embedded into security workflows, identity systems, and automation pipelines, the real risk isn’t that AI might be wrong. The real risk is giving a probabilistic system authority in places that require certainty.\nThis session reframes AI security from “model safety” to **architecture safety**.\nWe’ll explore how trust, identity, governance, and control planes must evolve as intelligence becomes non-deterministic.\nIf you work in cybersecurity, cloud, or engineering, this is how you stay ahead of the threat landscape going into 2026.\nJoin Andrew Stafford for a practical, architect-level breakdown of what secure AI systems must look like at enterprise scale.\n\n***\n\n# 🔍 What You’ll Learn\n\n**Why AI changes the fundamentals of security architecture**\nHow probabilistic systems break assumptions behind IAM, RBAC, and traditional controls.\n**The real AI threat model for 2026**\nPrompt injection, over-permissioned agents, shadow AI, and why these are architectural failures, not model failures.\n**Why AI must never sit in the authority path**\nThe critical boundary between planning, policy, and execution.\n**The control plane vs data plane model for AI security**\nWhere AI belongs, where it must never go, and how this separation prevents catastrophic failure.\n**Plan → Verify → Execute: the secure AI pattern**\nHow AI proposes, security decides, and systems act.\n**AI agents as identities**\nWhy agents must be treated like PAM workloads with strict scoping, short-lived credentials, and approval paths.\n**Guardrails that actually work**\nWhere enforcement must happen:\n\n* Before retrieval\n* Before execution\n* Before data leaves your system\n\n**What “explainability” really means in enterprise security**\nNot how the model thinks, but why the system acted.\n**How secure systems should fail**\nLoss of intelligence is acceptable. Loss of control is not.\nYou’ll leave with a new mental model for designing AI systems that are **controllable, auditable, and defensible**.\n\n***\n\n# 🎙️ Your Speaker\n\n## Andrew Stafford\n\nCo-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads\n25+ years across cybersecurity, cloud, and AI architecture including work with Amazon, NASA, healthcare platforms, and enterprise security systems.\nSpecializes in designing AI systems that remain secure, explainable, and governable at scale.\n\n***\n\n# Who should attend?\n\n* Cybersecurity professionals\n* Cloud & platform engineers\n* Identity & IAM architects\n* Security leaders and CISOs\n* AI engineers building production systems\n* Anyone responsible for deploying AI in regulated or high-trust environments\n\n***\n\n# Why this matters\n\nWe’re entering an era where intelligence is cheap and uncertainty is embedded into systems.\nSecurity can no longer assume:\n\n* Deterministic logic\n* Predictable behavior\n* Clear trust boundaries\n\nAI forces us to move from **trusting intelligence** to **controlling authority**.\nThis talk shows how to build AI systems that can:\n\n* Be paused\n* Be explained\n* Be audited\n* Be contained\n\nBecause in 2026, the most valuable AI systems won’t be the smartest.\nThey’ll be the ones that remain safe when something goes wrong.\n\n**Organizers & Partners**\n\n**Organizers**\n[The AI Collective Hampton Roads](https://linktr.ee/aicollectivehr)\n\n**Platinum partner**\n[TechArk Solutions](https://gotechark.com/)\n[Regent University](https://www.regent.edu/)\n\n**Silver partner**\n[Assembly Norfolk](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)\n[TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/)\n\n**Space partner**\n757 Collab\n\n\\- \\- \\-\n\n**Our parent org**\n[The AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/) is a global non-profit community uniting 100,000+ pioneers – founders, researchers, operators, and investors – exploring the frontier of AI in major tech hubs worldwide.

The talk focuses on how SQL Server was used to model users, roles, and permissions; support reliable change propagation; and enable auditing, deprovisioning, and session management at scale.\n\nAttendees will learn practical lessons around schema design, transactional consistency, asynchronous replication, and operational monitoring for identity data. The techniques discussed apply broadly to any system where correctness, availability, and security depend on a well-designed and highly reliable SQL Server data layer.",

    "description": "## Using AI to Think Like a Successful Entrepreneur\n\n### How to ideate, research, and validate ideas faster—without fooling yourself\n\nMost people think entrepreneurship starts with a great idea.\nIn reality, it starts with **a hypothesis**—and most hypotheses are wrong.\nAI has dramatically lowered the cost of ideation, research, and execution. But it has *not* lowered the cost of being wrong. In fact, used carelessly, AI can help founders move faster in the wrong direction.\nThis live session shows how to use AI the way strong entrepreneurs do:\nas a **thinking system** that accelerates learning, sharpens judgment, and helps you discover what the market actually wants.\nThis is **not** a prompt demo or a tool roundup.\nIt’s a practical walkthrough of the entrepreneurial discovery process—and where AI fits (and where it doesn’t).\n\n***\n\n## What You’ll Learn\n\n### Entrepreneurship as a discoverable process\n\nWhy successful founders follow the same core steps across industries—and how skipping steps dramatically lowers your odds of success.\n\n### AI’s proper role in entrepreneurship\n\nHow AI can expand options, compress research time, and pressure-test assumptions—without replacing market contact or real-world learning.\n\n### Step 1: Ideation (Diverge first)\n\nHow to use AI to:\n\n* Generate many problem hypotheses inside a niche\n* Surface recurring frustrations and “workarounds people tolerate”\n* Avoid prematurely falling in love with an idea\n\nWhy most ideas *should* die early—and how to kill them quickly and cheaply.\n\n### Step 2: Research the human reality\n\nHow to stop guessing and use AI to:\n\n* Draft and refine ICP hypotheses\n* Understand incentives, constraints, and customer language\n* Identify what people are actually doing today—and why\n\nWhy competitors are rarely the real threat—and what you’re actually replacing.\n\n### Step 3: Validation is behavioral\n\nWhy interest doesn’t equal validation—and what *does*:\n\n* Time committed\n* Money risked\n* Behavior changed\n\nHow to design the **smallest honest test** (landing pages, pre-sales, concierge MVPs, pilots) to answer:\n\n> “Is this problem worth solving for this group at this price?”\n\n### Letting the market answer\n\nHow to interpret:\n\n* No response\n* Some interest, no commitment\n* Strong response\n\n—and what the *correct move* is in each case (refine, step back, or double down).\n\n***\n\n## Who Should Attend\n\n* Aspiring founders exploring ideas but unsure what’s worth pursuing\n* Early-stage founders stuck in research, planning, or endless iteration\n* Builders who want to use AI for *thinking*, not just output\n* Anyone who wants to reduce wasted effort and learn faster from the market\n\n***\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAI makes it easy to generate ideas, write plans, and build quickly.\nIt does **not** make it easy to discover truth.\nYour advantage isn’t speed alone—it’s:\n\n* Asking better questions\n* Testing the right assumptions\n* Learning faster from reality\n\nThis session shows how to use AI to support that process—without mistaking activity for progress.\n\n**🤝 Organizers & partners**\n**​**\n**Organizers**\n[The AI Collective Hampton Roads](https://linktr.ee/aicollectivehr)\n\n**​Platinum partners**\n[TechArk](https://gotechark.com/)\n[Regent University](https://www.regent.edu/)\n[ECPI University](https://www.ecpi.edu/)\n\n**​Silver partners**\n[TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/)\n[Assembly](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)\n\n**​Space partner**\n[757 Collab](https://757collab.org/)\n[The Hive by Virginia Beach](https://yesvirginiabeach.com/the-hive)\n[NSU Innovation Center](https://www.nsu.edu/Academics/Research/Foundations-and-Centers-of-Excellence/NSU-Innovation-Center)\n\n**🌍 ​Our parent org**\n[The AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/) is a global non-profit community uniting 150,000+ pioneers – founders, researchers, operators, and investors – exploring the frontier of AI in major tech hubs worldwide.

In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
