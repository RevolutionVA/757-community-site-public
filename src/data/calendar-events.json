However the day to day development experience can still feel antiquated and limiting.\nIn this talk, we will take a look at a few open source tools - JBang, SDKMAN, jgitver and JReleaser - that are making a difference. Whether you are a novice or a seasoned developer, these tools will simplify your end-to-end workflow by taking care of aspects ranging from installing and managing JDKs to versioning and releasing your applications.",

Python has been the language of choice for data science, automation, and AI. Now, they live together in the same workbook.\n\nThis talk will explore the power of **Python in Excel** \\- what it is\\, and how it changes the game for analysts\\, developers\\, and decision\\-makers\\. We'll look at practical use cases\\, from wrangling data with pandas to building models that go far beyond traditional formulas\\. You'll see live examples of how Python complements Excel rather than replacing it\\, bridging the gap between quick spreadsheet tsks and full\\-scale programming\\.\n\nWhether you're an Excel power user curious about Python or a Pythonista curious about Excel, you'll leave with a roadmap to get started and a sense of the **data-shaped future of software development**.\n\nBio:\nPaul is a retired pharmacist, former business owner, and lifelong learner who has pivoted into the software/data-analytics space. He started in Android development but now focuses on **Excel, Python, and data analysis**, framing his work as \"dispensing data\" rather than prescriptions. With a beginning practice in data consulting under the banner *Data Compounded, LLC*, Paul is passionate about teaching others how to combine familiar tools like Excel with modern programming and AI. Off ours, he's a first-time grandfather who trains consistently - protein, resistance training and Zone 2 cardio.
