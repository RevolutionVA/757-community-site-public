    "description": "**Click to [LEARN MORE](https://levelzeroconference.com/)**\n\nJoin the **premier event for OT cyber security professionals**, where engineering meets cyber security to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nThe **Level Zero Conference** brings experts from across industries together to address the complex challenges of securing operational technology. Our multidisciplinary approach integrates engineering, cyber security, and risk management to safeguard critical infrastructure from level zero to the cloud.\n\nIT and OT have traditionally operated in silos, with each team lacking a critical understanding of the other. The Level Zero Conference bridges this divide by bringing together experts from OT and IT – engineering, operations, and cyber security.\n\nFostering collaboration and cross-disciplinary understanding are both essential for the protection of critical infrastructure. Through the exchange of ideas and expertise, Level Zero empowers professionals from different domains to develop a deeper understanding of both IT and OT environments enabling the creation of infrastructure that is integrated and resilient to evolving threats.\n\n**Level Zero Conference** is where the future of OT cyber security is shaped. **Don’t miss this opportunity to contribute to and learn from the industry’s leading minds.**\n\n**[REGISTER HERE](https://levelzeroconference.com/)**\n\n===============================================================\n\n[Register now](https://levelzeroconference.com/)\n[LevelZeroConference.com](https://levelzeroconference.com/)\nInterested in presenting or sponsoring?

One of the initial steps is to get a list of OT assets, which used to be a rudimentary spreadsheet exercise. With the wide availability of passive OT asset discovery tools, many go down that path via a Proof of Concept to generate Asset Inventory.\n\nThis talk focused on lessons learnt from the trenches performing the proof of concepts and covers challenges including availability of infrastructure (span ports/tap, routing, bandwidth), archaic protocol implementations, organizational policies for network flows, risk appetite for active probing on low traffic networks, OT & IT personnel knowledge of each other’s domains, and finally budgeting.\n\n***[CLICK HERE TO REGISTER](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AlQ2Npfhji13uI8iSrGT6yUt8PQkxeguixWUJTdOjp8Sx-soNBEj~ArOcCR2HlaBSPel80_ZqIzh8Jv-xCmHeenRoraHpxEi7LUyhM6zphJPfRRq-9ecSIdYA9tZ8ZBYiuBNWQ6nUKSK49g)***\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nBecoming a paid member is quick and easy \\(and helps us keep offering these educational opportunities\\!\\)\\.

    "description": "**IN PERSON ONLY. NO VIRTUAL OPTION. Come hang out, network, and learn something!**\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.",
