    "description": "**IN PERSON ONLY. NO VIRTUAL OPTION. Come hang out, network, and learn something!**\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.",

A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.\n\nPeople who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.\n\nSalaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.\n\n**The course is open to the public.**\n[https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained](https://bit.ly/BUiLT_Trained)",

In this powerful keynote, Courtney and Dr. Tye Caldwell share how fear has been a constant companion on their journey—from navigating major business decisions to parenting with purpose to pushing past physical and mental limits on the world’s toughest climbs.\n\nThrough real-life stories and hard-earned insights, they challenge the idea that fear is something to avoid. Instead, they show how embracing fear can be the key to achieving audacious goals. Whether you’re launching a startup, stepping into leadership, making a career pivot or life-changing decision, raising the next generation, or tackling a personal challenge that seems insurmountable, the lesson is clear: the greatest breakthroughs happen when you do it scared. 🚀\n\nAudiences will rethink fear, reframe risk, and take bold steps toward their biggest goals.\n\nParticipate in the Career and Vendor Expo, daily from 5:00 - 6:30 pm.
