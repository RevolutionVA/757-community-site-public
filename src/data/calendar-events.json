[Vue.js](http://vue.js/) was invented by Evan You as a simple JavaScript framework because he wanted a more lightweight version of AngularJS. The idea behind it is that it is a middle ground between React and Angular, with Angular being heavier and React being lighter. The purpose is that you have the option to use more advanced features if you want to, but you don't need to have them. The other notable thing is that it is maintained by Evan You and the Vue community, as opposed to React being maintained by Facebook and Angular being maintained by Google.\"\n\nAll skill levels are welcome!

    "description": "**Event title:** Our Final Invention: A Community Town Hall on Navigating the Age of AGI\n\n**Event description:**\nThe smartest people in the room are getting scared. Geoffrey Hinton, the \"Godfather of AI,\" left Google specifically to warn us about the technology he helped create. Top researchers now predict that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)‚ÄîAI with human-level cognitive abilities‚Äîcould arrive between 2027 and 2030.\n\nWhat happens when we are no longer the smartest beings on the planet?\n\nThis isn't just about a \"bigger ChatGPT\". We're on the verge of a technology that can learn, reason, and solve novel problems on its own ‚Äîan intellect that could eventually become vastly smarter than the best human brains in every field. The leap could be as significant as the one between a housefly and Einstein.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. An aligned AGI could help us cure all diseases and end poverty. A misaligned one could lead to scenarios like an eternal AI dictatorship or even extermination by indifference.\n\nThe time to talk about this is not when it happens. It's right now.\n\nJoin us for a community town hall to tackle the most important questions of our time. This is not a lecture; it's a moderated, interactive discussion where your voice is crucial. We will explore:\n\n* **Our community's role:** Given the global nature of the AGI race, what meaningful role can a local tech community like ours play in promoting AI safety?\n* **Defining our values:** What core human values (like compassion or fairness) should we demand be embedded into these systems before they become too powerful to control?\n* **Preparing for disruption:** How do we prepare our local economy and workforce for the massive, inevitable disruption AGI will cause to almost every job?\n* **The global pause dilemma:** Should a company on the verge of AGI be required to pause and collaborate globally, or is that a naive hope in a high-stakes competitive race?\n* **A call to action:** What is the single most important action‚Äîpersonal, professional, or political‚Äîthat you can take *this year* to positively influence the outcome?\n\n***\n\n**Who should attend?**\nThis conversation is for everyone: tech professionals, entrepreneurs, policymakers, students, and any concerned citizen who wants to understand and shape the future of humanity in the age of intelligent machines.\n\n***\n\n**About the moderators**\nThis town hall will be moderated by **Andrew Stafford** and **Lionel Sapp**.\n\nAndrew is a founding member and a director for The AI Collective Hampton Roads and cofounder of the AI startup Your AI Group. With 24 years in tech, including roles at Amazon, NASA, and multiple startups, he is an author of 11 books and a board advisor with deep experience in building and deploying advanced technology.\n\nLionel Sapp, founder of The Digital Builders 757, empowers communities through tech, creativity, and collaboration. Through events and content, he helps people build skills, launch ideas, and connect with innovators, blending his background in software, marketing, and strategy to drive local innovation.\n\n***\n\n*This event was organized by The AI Collective Hampton Roads & The Digital Builders 757*\n\n***\n\n**Partners**\n\n* **Platinum**\n* [TechArk](https://gotechark.com/) \\- An award\\-winning marketing and technology partner that helps clients reimagine their businesses through innovative digital solutions\\.\n* **Space**\n* NSU Innovation Center\n\n***\n\n**Agenda**\n\n* **6:00 PM:** Doors Open & Networking\n* **7:15 PM:** Introduction: Framing the AGI Challenge\n* **7:30 PM:** Moderated Town Hall Discussion\n* **8:30 PM:** Closing Remarks & Final Q&A\n* **8:45 PM:** Continued Networking\n\n***\n\n**Connect with the community**\n\n* **The AI Collective Hampton Roads**\n* **Meetup:** [https://www.meetup.com/757-artificial-intelligence/](https://www.meetup.com/757-artificial-intelligence/)\n* **Luma:** [https://luma.com/user/aicollectivehr](https://luma.com/user/aicollectivehr)\n* **Discord (Slides available here):** [https://discord.gg/pMpdNHJDEJ](https://discord.gg/pMpdNHJDEJ)\n* **The AI Collective:** [https://www.aicollective.com](https://www.aicollective.com/)",

Now, they live together in the same workbook.\n\nThis talk will explore the power of **Python in Excel** \\- what it is\\, and how it changes the game for analysts\\, developers\\, and decision\\-makers\\. We'll look at practical use cases\\, from wrangling data with pandas to building models that go far beyond traditional formulas\\. You'll see live examples of how Python complements Excel rather than replacing it\\, bridging the gap between quick spreadsheet tsks and full\\-scale programming\\.\n\nWhether you're an Excel power user curious about Python or a Pythonista curious about Excel, you'll leave with a roadmap to get started and a sense of the **data-shaped future of software development**.\n\nBio:\nPaul is a retired pharmacist, former business owner, and lifelong learner who has pivoted into the software/data-analytics space. He started in Android development but now focuses on **Excel, Python, and data analysis**, framing his work as \"dispensing data\" rather than prescriptions. With a beginning practice in data consulting under the banner *Data Compounded, LLC*, Paul is passionate about teaching others how to combine familiar tools like Excel with modern programming and AI. Off ours, he's a first-time grandfather who trains consistently - protein, resistance training and Zone 2 cardio. He and his Ukrainian wife have opened their home to Ukrainian refugees.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis hybrid meeting will be available both in-person and remotely.
