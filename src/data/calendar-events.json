    "description": "RFID is everywhere‚Äîyet few understand it. From toy tags to access cards and even passports, RFID is part of our daily lives. Unfortunately, that also makes it a popular target for attackers who know how to exploit its weaknesses.\nIn this talk, Erich Jackson will lift the veil on RFID by showing how the technology works, how hackers clone and spoof RFID signals, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîwhat security professionals can do to protect against these threats. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge they can use to better understand, evaluate, and secure the RFID-enabled assets around them. Whether you're new to RFID or want a deeper technical edge, this presentation will give you the tools to move from passive user to informed defender.\n\nSpeaker:\nErich Jackson is a Pentest Architect at a Fortune 500 company and the founder of Halberd Security. He has spoken at conferences including HackRedCon, ISSA DC & Louisville, the DRI Trucking Law Conference, and Nerd Nite Louisville. Erich contributes to the security community through his open-source library work and holds a U.S. patent in automatic foreign language translation. He holds numerous advanced certifications including GXPN, GWAPT, GPEN, GCSA, and GCIH from SANS.\nHis current research focuses on offensive security, physical access systems, and bridging the gap between hardware and network exploitation.\n\n***After-Social:***\nWe will meet at Plaza DeGollado Mexican Grill for the after-social.

But what if it didn't need to be this way. What if we could just write some plain english tests that simply state what we want to test, and not worry about page structure, XPaths, etc. We can!\n\nIn this talk we'll look at using an open-source project called Skyvern, coupled with Azure OpenAI to run automated E2E tests only using natural language prompts. Skyvern automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. Combined with the ease of Azure OpenAI, we can quickly build automated testing solutions that can give time back to engineers, and make testing easier and more complete.\n\nWe'll take a look at the parts of this solution, and walk through a simple build that can test any website and report back on its findings.",
