Collaboration has become the ultimate competitive edge. From billion-dollar co-sell deals to co-branded events, cross-promotional marketing, and community-driven partnerships, the most impactful wins in tech today are happening through strategic alliances—not solo efforts.\n\nIn 2025, the fastest growing tech companies aren’t the ones with the best product; in reality, it’s the ones with the best partnerships. Whether it’s a business development team using channel partnerships to acquire enterprise customers, or a startup promoting a cloud company in exchange for data center services; no one is doing it alone. This keynote explores the power of collaborations, and how tech companies, and tech communities are scaling their businesses through strategic partnerships.\n\nThere was a time when companies would solely compete on their product, but now the new currency in partnerships, and great partnership can fuel a business beyond expectations. Attendees will learn how to leverage these diverse partnership models, either as a founder, employee, or community builder.\n\nThis talk is designed to positively shift mindsets from going solo to growing together. Key Objectives: 1. Provide a comprehensive overview of the partnership ecosystem in tech and what it means for founders, employees, and community builders. 2. Showcase how tech and marketing partnerships drive growth, visibility, and access to new audiences. 3. Equip attendees with partnership strategies they can apply across business development, sales, marketing, and community engagement. Intended Audience: Entrepreneurs, Executives, Mid & Early Career Tech professionals, Tech Non-Profit and Community Builders.\n\nParticipate in the Career and Vendor Expo, daily from 5:00 - 6:30 pm.

    "description": "**IN PERSON ONLY. NO VIRTUAL OPTION. Come hang out, network, and learn something!**\n\nAbstract:\nHexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined \"ports,\" following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.\n\nScreaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.",
