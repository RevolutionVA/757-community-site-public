    "description": "**From single prompts to coordinated AI teams**\n\nAI agents are moving beyond simple chatbots. In this talk, you will see how multi-agent systems work together to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. Using CrewAI as the framework, we will explore practical patterns that scale from experiments to real production use cases across engineering, operations, and knowledge work.\n\nThis session blends concepts with live examples so attendees leave with both understanding and inspiration.\n\n**🔍 What you’ll learn**\n\n* What multi-agent systems are and why they matter now\n* Core agent roles such as planners, executors, reviewers, and coordinators\n* How CrewAI structures collaboration between agents\n* Practical demos that show agents working together on real problems\n* How the same agent setup can be adapted for resumes, sales workflows, ops automation, and internal tooling\n* Where multi-agent systems break down and how to design around common pitfalls\n\n**🎙️ Your speaker**\n**[Tim Masterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-masterson-a202574/)**\n\nPrincipal Architect of Streaming at Paramount+ and Pluto TV\n\nTim leads large-scale distributed systems powering millions of users across major streaming platforms. He brings deep experience in system architecture, AI-assisted workflows, and production-grade engineering. His focus is not hype, but how emerging AI patterns actually work when reliability, scale, and teams matter.\n\n**👥 Who should attend?**\n\n* Software engineers and architects\n* Product managers and technical founders\n* Data, ML, and AI practitioners\n* Consultants and automation builders\n* Students and job seekers curious about agent-based systems\n* Anyone exploring how AI moves from demos to durable systems\n\nNo prior CrewAI experience required.\n\n**💡 Why this matters**\nSingle-prompt AI tools are reaching their limits. The next wave of useful AI comes from systems where multiple agents collaborate, critique, and adapt. Understanding how to design and reason about these systems now puts you ahead of where AI-powered products and workflows are heading.\n\nIf you want to build AI that feels less like a tool and more like a capable team, this session is for you.\n\n**ℹ️ Other bits of info & FAQs**\nIs there free parking in the area?\nYes.

Used well, it can compress thinking and sharpen decisions. Used poorly, it multiplies distraction and half-finished plans.\n\nThis live session introduces a **founder-grade annual planning framework**—and shows you how to use AI as a thinking partner to articulate your ideas, pressure-test your assumptions, and turn intention into action.\n\nThis is not a generic goal-setting workshop.\n\nIt’s a practical operating process you can repeat every year—and revisit quarterly.\n\nJoin **Andrew Stafford** for a guided walkthrough designed for early-stage founders, aspiring founders, and builders who want to stop spinning and start executing.\n\n# ​**🔍 What You’ll Learn**\n\n**Why most annual plans fail before February**\nThe hidden reasons founders lose momentum—and how to avoid planning theater.\n\n**The Founder Operating Plan**\nA clear, repeatable framework to move from ideas → decisions → execution.\n\n**How to use AI as a founder’s thinking partner**\nUse AI to articulate vague ideas, clarify priorities, and stress-test decisions—without outsourcing responsibility.\n\n**Constraints before goals**\nHow identifying your real constraint (time, capital, energy, skill, market) makes strategy simpler and execution faster.\n\n**The Focus Filter**\nHow to choose *one* primary focus for the year—and intentionally downgrade everything else.\n\n**Turning vision into 12-week action**\nHow to translate long-term goals into near-term execution plans with built-in review and adjustment loops.\n\nYou’ll leave knowing **exactly how to finish your annual plan**, how often to revisit it, and how to use AI responsibly as part of the process.\n\n# ​**🎙️ Your Speakers**\n\n## ​**Andrew Stafford**\n\n​Co-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads chapter.\n​25 years across two startups, Amazon, NASA, and major enterprise consulting.\n\n# ​**Who should attend?**\n\n* Aspiring founders with a strong idea but no clear execution framework\n* Early-stage founders feeling busy but unfocused\n* Builders and operators exploring how to use AI beyond surface-level tasks\n* Anyone who wants a **repeatable yearly planning process**, not another productivity hack\n\n# ​**Why this matters**\n\nWe are entering a phase where **ideas are cheap and tools are abundant**.\nYour advantage is no longer effort alone—it’s:\n\n* Clarity\n* Focus\n* Decision quality\n* Follow-through\n\nAI can either amplify confusion—or sharpen execution.\nThis session shows you how to make it the latter.\n\n**🤝 Organizers & partners**\n\n**Organizers**\n[The AI Collective Hampton Roads](https://linktr.ee/aicollectivehr)\n\n**​Platinum partners**\n[TechArk](https://gotechark.com/)\n[Regent University](https://www.regent.edu/)\n[ECPI University](https://www.ecpi.edu/)\n\n**​Silver partners**\n[TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/)\n[Assembly](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)\n\n**🌍 ​Our parent org**\n[The AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/) is a global non-profit community uniting 150,000+ pioneers – founders, researchers, operators, and investors – exploring the frontier of AI in major tech hubs worldwide.

    "description": "**IN PERSON MEETING!!!!!**\nAs SaaS platforms grow through acquisitions, identity data often becomes fragmented across multiple databases and user stores, leading to inconsistent access controls, operational complexity, and security risk. This session presents a real-world case study of consolidating authentication and authorization into a centralized, SQL Server–backed identity platform used across multiple products.\n\nThe solution combined OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 with a central identity database, token-time claim enrichment, and event-driven replication to maintain data consistency while supporting near-zero-downtime migrations. The talk focuses on how SQL Server was used to model users, roles, and permissions; support reliable change propagation; and enable auditing, deprovisioning, and session management at scale.\n\nAttendees will learn practical lessons around schema design, transactional consistency, asynchronous replication, and operational monitoring for identity data. The techniques discussed apply broadly to any system where correctness, availability, and security depend on a well-designed and highly reliable SQL Server data layer.",

In this meetup, we'll explore the key advantages that drive teams to adopt Kotlin—from improved developer productivity and safer Android apps to structured concurrency with coroutines on the backend. We'll highlight how Kotlin aligns with today's Android ecosystem, integrates with popular backend frameworks, and enables cleaner, more maintainable code across platforms. At the same time, adopting Kotlin is not without challenges. We'll take an honest look at the tradeoffs, including learning curve considerations, build performance, interoperability friction with legacy Java code, and operational concerns in backend systems. Through a retrospective lens, this talk will share practical lessons learned and guidance on when Kotlin is the right choice—and when it may not be—helping attendees make informed decisions for their Android and server-side projects.\n\nThis is a Hybrid event, you can also attend virtually using this link: TBA",
