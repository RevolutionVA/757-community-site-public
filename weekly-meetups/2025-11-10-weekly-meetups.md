#### WSDG November Technical Presentation

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** The Williamsburg Software Developers Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/the-williamsburg-software-developers-group/events/311494202/)

**Description:**
Python in Excel
by Paul Doolittle

Abstract:
Excel has been the world's most widely used analysis tool for decades. Python has been the language of choice for data science, automation, and AI. Now, they live together in the same workbook.

This talk will explore the power of **Python in Excel** \- what it is\, and how it changes the game for analysts\, developers\, and decision\-makers\. We'll look at practical use cases\, from wrangling data with pandas to building models that go far beyond traditional formulas\. You'll see live examples of how Python complements Excel rather than replacing it\, bridging the gap between quick spreadsheet tsks and full\-scale programming\.

Whether you're an Excel power user curious about Python or a Pythonista curious about Excel, you'll leave with a roadmap to get started and a sense of the **data-shaped future of software development**.

Bio:
Paul is a retired pharmacist, former business owner, and lifelong learner who has pivoted into the software/data-analytics space. He started in Android development but now focuses on **Excel, Python, and data analysis**, framing his work as "dispensing data" rather than prescriptions. With a beginning practice in data consulting under the banner *Data Compounded, LLC*, Paul is passionate about teaching others how to combine familiar tools like Excel with modern programming and AI. Off ours, he's a first-time grandfather who trains consistently - protein, resistance training and Zone 2 cardio. He and his Ukrainian wife have opened their home to Ukrainian refugees.
