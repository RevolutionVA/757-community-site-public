#### Ty Smith Keynote - “Collaboration Is the New Currency"

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307164589/)

**Description:**
Join Houston's best Black Tech professionals and organizations, plus their allies, for the 3rd Annual Houston Black Tech Symposium.

Be enlightened by the 6 Keynotes, 45 Sessions, and evening Workshop presentations on the latest tech topics, career development, and on how to get into tech.

Hear Ty Smith's exposé about our world where speed, scale, and visibility are everything. Collaboration has become the ultimate competitive edge. From billion-dollar co-sell deals to co-branded events, cross-promotional marketing, and community-driven partnerships, the most impactful wins in tech today are happening through strategic alliances—not solo efforts.

In 2025, the fastest growing tech companies aren’t the ones with the best product; in reality, it’s the ones with the best partnerships. Whether it’s a business development team using channel partnerships to acquire enterprise customers, or a startup promoting a cloud company in exchange for data center services; no one is doing it alone. This keynote explores the power of collaborations, and how tech companies, and tech communities are scaling their businesses through strategic partnerships.

There was a time when companies would solely compete on their product, but now the new currency in partnerships, and great partnership can fuel a business beyond expectations. Attendees will learn how to leverage these diverse partnership models, either as a founder, employee, or community builder.

This talk is designed to positively shift mindsets from going solo to growing together. Key Objectives: 1. Provide a comprehensive overview of the partnership ecosystem in tech and what it means for founders, employees, and community builders. 2. Showcase how tech and marketing partnerships drive growth, visibility, and access to new audiences. 3. Equip attendees with partnership strategies they can apply across business development, sales, marketing, and community engagement. Intended Audience: Entrepreneurs, Executives, Mid & Early Career Tech professionals, Tech Non-Profit and Community Builders.

Participate in the Career and Vendor Expo, daily from 5:00 - 6:30 pm. Meet other tech professionals in the daily, virtual networking sessions.

Registration packages start at $125, with six keynote presentations, three concurrent daily sessions, workshops, and a Career Expo. Register [HERE](https://bit.ly/3rdHTX-BlackTechSymposium). Participate to win valuable door prizes.
