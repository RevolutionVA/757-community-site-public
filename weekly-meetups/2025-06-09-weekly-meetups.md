#### Courtney & Dr. Ty Caldwell Keynote - “Doing it Scared"

- **Time:** 01:00 PM

- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307689166/)

Join North Texas's best Black Tech professionals and organizations, plus their allies, for the 5th Annual Houston Black Tech Symposium.

Be enlightened by the 6 Keynotes, 45 Sessions, and evening Workshop presentations on the latest tech topics, career development, and how to get into tech.

Fear is universal—whether you’re scaling a business, raising a family, or climbing a literal mountain. In this powerful keynote, Courtney and Dr. Tye Caldwell share how fear has been a constant companion on their journey—from navigating major business decisions to parenting with purpose to pushing past physical and mental limits on the world’s toughest climbs.

Through real-life stories and hard-earned insights, they challenge the idea that fear is something to avoid. Instead, they show how embracing fear can be the key to achieving audacious goals. Whether you’re launching a startup, stepping into leadership, making a career pivot or life-changing decision, raising the next generation, or tackling a personal challenge that seems insurmountable, the lesson is clear: the greatest breakthroughs happen when you do it scared. 🚀

Audiences will rethink fear, reframe risk, and take bold steps toward their biggest goals.

#### Get in tech with Scrum

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307673331/)

**Description:**
Join this 1-hour technical primer on What is a Scrum Master.

A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team to manage the flow of information between team members. A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.

People who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.

Salaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

**The course is open to the public.**
