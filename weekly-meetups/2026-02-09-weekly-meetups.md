### Thursday, February 12

#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective Hampton Roads | Securing AI in 2026

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/313066851/)

**Description:**
**From Intelligence to Authority: Securing AI in 2026**

*Why AI makes security architecture more important, not less.*

This is a **live, digital-only event** focused on how AI is reshaping cybersecurity, identity, and enterprise architecture. No in-person attendance. Join from anywhere.

As AI systems become embedded into security workflows, identity systems, and automation pipelines, the real risk isn’t that AI might be wrong. The real risk is giving a probabilistic system authority in places that require certainty.

This session reframes AI security from “model safety” to **architecture safety**.

We’ll explore how trust, identity, governance, and control planes must evolve as intelligence becomes non-deterministic.

If you work in cybersecurity, cloud, or engineering, this is how you stay ahead of the threat landscape going into 2026.

Join Andrew Stafford for a practical, architect-level breakdown of what secure AI systems must look like at enterprise scale.

**🔍 What You’ll Learn**

**Why AI changes the fundamentals of security architecture**
How probabilistic systems break assumptions behind IAM, RBAC, and traditional controls.

**The real AI threat model for 2026**
Prompt injection, over-permissioned agents, shadow AI, and why these are architectural failures, not model failures.

**Why AI must never sit in the authority path**
The critical boundary between planning, policy, and execution.

**The control plane vs data plane model for AI security**
Where AI belongs, where it must never go, and how this separation prevents catastrophic failure.

**Plan → Verify → Execute: the secure AI pattern**
How AI proposes, security decides, and systems act.

**AI agents as identities**
Why agents must be treated like PAM workloads with strict scoping, short-lived credentials, and approval paths.

**Guardrails that actually work**
Where enforcement must happen:

* Before retrieval
* Before execution
* Before data leaves your system

**What “explainability” really means in enterprise security**
Not how the model thinks, but why the system acted.

**How secure systems should fail**
Loss of intelligence is acceptable. Loss of control is not.
You’ll leave with a new mental model for designing AI systems that are **controllable, auditable, and defensible**.

**🎙️ Your speaker**

**Andrew Stafford**
Co-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads
25+ years across cybersecurity, cloud, and AI architecture including work with Amazon, NASA, healthcare platforms, and enterprise security systems.
Specializes in designing AI systems that remain secure, explainable, and governable at scale.

**Who should attend?**

* Cybersecurity professionals
* Cloud & platform engineers
* Identity & IAM architects
* Security leaders and CISOs
* AI engineers building production systems
* Anyone responsible for deploying AI in regulated or high-trust environments

**Why this matters**

We’re entering an era where intelligence is cheap and uncertainty is embedded into systems.
Security can no longer assume:

* Deterministic logic
* Predictable behavior
* Clear trust boundaries

AI forces us to move from **trusting intelligence** to **controlling authority**.
This talk shows how to build AI systems that can:

* Be paused
* Be explained
* Be audited
* Be contained

Because in 2026, the most valuable AI systems won’t be the smartest.
They’ll be the ones that remain safe when something goes wrong.
