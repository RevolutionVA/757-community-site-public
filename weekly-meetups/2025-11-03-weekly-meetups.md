#### Supercharge Your Java Development Experience with Open Source Tools

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Java Users Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/hampton-roads-java-users-group/events/311409262/)

**Description:**
Presented by: Sujith Paul
Abstract: Even though it is almost 30 years old, the Java ecosystem has continued to stay relevant by adapting to the ever changing technology landscape. However the day to day development experience can still feel antiquated and limiting.
In this talk, we will take a look at a few open source tools - JBang, SDKMAN, jgitver and JReleaser - that are making a difference. Whether you are a novice or a seasoned developer, these tools will simplify your end-to-end workflow by taking care of aspects ranging from installing and managing JDKs to versioning and releasing your applications.
