## 2 Meetups This Week

### Monday, December 29

#### We're getting the band back together.

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Python Users Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/757-python-users-group/events/312554590/)

**Description:**
Wow gang, it has been a while! The meetup next week is for general planning for 2026 and no specific topics are planned.

The good news is that I finally found reliable funding sources and will be able to start regular hosting of our Python events again.

I will be teaching my entomology class again in the fall at Virginia Western Community College in Roanoke. They also have a couple of great computer lab spaces we can used to host a hybrid Python meetup. This spring we can do introduction to git versioning and venv like we always do, and add some in person lab practice. I plan to deploy an array of Raspberry Pis for the lab.

If you have specific Python modules that you would like to learn about, please send me a note. The foundation wants to promote real world usage. Once you get past the language basics there are a lot of very useful packages that make your professional work easier.

Fun times ahead!
Micah

#### (CS)²AI Online™ Replay: When Data Eats SCADA

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/312398985/)

**Description:**
***Industry 4.0 and digital transformation is causing a shift in the risk model for industrial security as the data produced by operations becomes as valuable (or more valuable) than the actual operations. An example could be an electric utility that discounts the cost of electricity as incentive to get permission to use some (or all) of the operations and usage data.***

***The value of the electrons is essentially fixed where the value of the operational data is virtually unlimited. This creates an opportunity for additional profit potential for creation and sale of data products in addition to the electric power to the customer.***

***As the organizational profit center shifts to include operational assets as well as operational data and its path outside of the operational environment, so does the risk.***

***In this presentation, learn how to secure your modern/future industrial organization from the industrial process to the operational data products and beyond.***
