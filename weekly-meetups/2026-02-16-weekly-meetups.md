#### Kalyan Inturi-Designing a Central Identity DB Unifying Authentication

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads SQL Server User Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/hampton-roads-sql-server-user-group/events/312879970/)

**Description:**
**IN PERSON MEETING!!!!!**
As SaaS platforms grow through acquisitions, identity data often becomes fragmented across multiple databases and user stores, leading to inconsistent access controls, operational complexity, and security risk. This session presents a real-world case study of consolidating authentication and authorization into a centralized, SQL Server–backed identity platform used across multiple products.

The solution combined OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 with a central identity database, token-time claim enrichment, and event-driven replication to maintain data consistency while supporting near-zero-downtime migrations. The talk focuses on how SQL Server was used to model users, roles, and permissions; support reliable change propagation; and enable auditing, deprovisioning, and session management at scale.

Attendees will learn practical lessons around schema design, transactional consistency, asynchronous replication, and operational monitoring for identity data. The techniques discussed apply broadly to any system where correctness, availability, and security depend on a well-designed and highly reliable SQL Server data layer.

#### 🧜‍♀️AI Collective-HR | AI ideation, research, and validation

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/313055653/)

**Description:**
## **Using AI to Think Like a Successful Entrepreneur**

*An AI-powered ideation, research, and validation workshop*

Building ideas is easy. Proving they matter is hard.

This hands-on workshop is designed to help you use AI as a thinking partner to move faster from vague ideas to clearer, validated directions. Instead of guessing or relying on gut instinct alone, you will learn practical ways to use AI to challenge assumptions, explore markets, and pressure-test ideas before you invest too much time or energy.
This session focuses on how founders, builders, and teams can use AI to think more clearly, ask better questions, and make more informed decisions. No hype. No pitch decks. Just practical frameworks you can apply right away.

**🔍 What you’ll learn**

* How to use AI to generate and refine early-stage ideas
* Turning assumptions into research questions instead of guesses
* Exploring customer and market perspectives with AI support
* Simple validation techniques you can use immediately
* How to move from intuition-driven thinking to evidence-informed decisions

This is not about memorizing prompts or chasing tools. It is about learning how to think better with AI in the loop.

**🧠 Your facilitators**
**[Andrew Stafford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theandrewstafford/)** is a Fractional Chief AI Officer and Director of Technology and Global Alliances at The AI Collective. He works with executive teams to establish clear ownership of AI decisions, focus on real ROI, and avoid unnecessary risk, tool sprawl, and hype-driven strategy.

**[Ted Patterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedjpatterson/)** is a Product and GTM Engineer at Reelist and a founding leader of The AI Collective Hampton Roads. With nearly 20 years of experience across product, research, design, and systems, he focuses on turning complex ideas into testable hypotheses, clear narratives, and practical next steps.

Together, Andrew and Ted will guide you through an end-to-end ideation, research, and validation flow that blends strategic thinking with hands-on experimentation.

**👥 Who should attend?**

* Founders and early-stage startup teams
* Product managers, designers, and engineers
* No-code and automation builders
* Researchers and analysts
* Students and career switchers exploring entrepreneurship
* Anyone curious about using AI to think more clearly about ideas and markets

No prior AI experience required.

**⚡ Why this matters**
AI is changing how ideas are formed, tested, and funded. The real advantage is not knowing more tools. It is knowing how to ask better questions, challenge assumptions earlier, and validate faster.
This session is about building that muscle.
