#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective Hampton Roads | Making Multi-Agent systems with CrewAI

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/312748157/)

**Description:**
**From single prompts to coordinated AI teams**

AI agents are moving beyond simple chatbots. In this talk, you will see how multi-agent systems work together to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. Using CrewAI as the framework, we will explore practical patterns that scale from experiments to real production use cases across engineering, operations, and knowledge work.

This session blends concepts with live examples so attendees leave with both understanding and inspiration.

**🔍 What you’ll learn**

* What multi-agent systems are and why they matter now
* Core agent roles such as planners, executors, reviewers, and coordinators
* How CrewAI structures collaboration between agents
* Practical demos that show agents working together on real problems
* How the same agent setup can be adapted for resumes, sales workflows, ops automation, and internal tooling
* Where multi-agent systems break down and how to design around common pitfalls

**🎙️ Your speaker**
**[Tim Masterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-masterson-a202574/)**

Principal Architect of Streaming at Paramount+ and Pluto TV

Tim leads large-scale distributed systems powering millions of users across major streaming platforms. He brings deep experience in system architecture, AI-assisted workflows, and production-grade engineering. His focus is not hype, but how emerging AI patterns actually work when reliability, scale, and teams matter.

**👥 Who should attend?**

* Software engineers and architects
* Product managers and technical founders
* Data, ML, and AI practitioners
* Consultants and automation builders
* Students and job seekers curious about agent-based systems
* Anyone exploring how AI moves from demos to durable systems

No prior CrewAI experience required.

**💡 Why this matters**
Single-prompt AI tools are reaching their limits. The next wave of useful AI comes from systems where multiple agents collaborate, critique, and adapt. Understanding how to design and reason about these systems now puts you ahead of where AI-powered products and workflows are heading.

If you want to build AI that feels less like a tool and more like a capable team, this session is for you.

### Saturday, January 24

#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective HR | Decide, Commit, Execute: Using AI to Plan Your Year

- **Time:** 10:00 AM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/312751893/)

**Description:**
## Decide, Commit, Execute: Using AI to Plan Your Year

**How founders use AI to create clarity, focus, and execution momentum for the year ahead.**

Most aspiring founders don’t struggle with motivation or ideas.
They struggle with *clarity, prioritization, and execution*.

AI has made this problem both better *and* worse. Used well, it can compress thinking and sharpen decisions. Used poorly, it multiplies distraction and half-finished plans.

This live session introduces a **founder-grade annual planning framework**—and shows you how to use AI as a thinking partner to articulate your ideas, pressure-test your assumptions, and turn intention into action.

This is not a generic goal-setting workshop.

It’s a practical operating process you can repeat every year—and revisit quarterly.

Join **Andrew Stafford** for a guided walkthrough designed for early-stage founders, aspiring founders, and builders who want to stop spinning and start executing.

# ​**🔍 What You’ll Learn**

**Why most annual plans fail before February**
The hidden reasons founders lose momentum—and how to avoid planning theater.

**The Founder Operating Plan**
A clear, repeatable framework to move from ideas → decisions → execution.

**How to use AI as a founder’s thinking partner**
Use AI to articulate vague ideas, clarify priorities, and stress-test decisions—without outsourcing responsibility.

**Constraints before goals**
How identifying your real constraint (time, capital, energy, skill, market) makes strategy simpler and execution faster.

**The Focus Filter**
How to choose *one* primary focus for the year—and intentionally downgrade everything else.

**Turning vision into 12-week action**
How to translate long-term goals into near-term execution plans with built-in review and adjustment loops.

You’ll leave knowing **exactly how to finish your annual plan**, how often to revisit it, and how to use AI responsibly as part of the process.

# ​**🎙️ Your Speakers**

## ​**Andrew Stafford**

​Co-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads chapter.
​25 years across two startups, Amazon, NASA, and major enterprise consulting.

# ​**Who should attend?**

* Aspiring founders with a strong idea but no clear execution framework
* Early-stage founders feeling busy but unfocused
* Builders and operators exploring how to use AI beyond surface-level tasks
* Anyone who wants a **repeatable yearly planning process**, not another productivity hack

# ​**Why this matters**

We are entering a phase where **ideas are cheap and tools are abundant**.
Your advantage is no longer effort alone—it’s:

* Clarity
* Focus
* Decision quality
* Follow-through

AI can either amplify confusion—or sharpen execution.
This session shows you how to make it the latter.
