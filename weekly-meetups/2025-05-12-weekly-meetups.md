#### Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads .NET User Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/hampton-roads-net-users-group/events/305991366/)

**Description:**
**IN PERSON ONLY. NO VIRTUAL OPTION. Come hang out, network, and learn something!**

Abstract:
Hexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined "ports," following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.

Screaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.

In this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.

#### Get in tech with Scrum

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307673281/)

**Description:**
Join this 1-hour technical primer on What is a Scrum Master.

A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team to manage the flow of information between team members. A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.

People who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.

Salaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

**The course is open to the public.**
