Last year, my most recommended service was https://val.town, a place that can run javascript and typescript with ease, nothing else quite like it. Join us for a walkthrough of val.town, and how I used it all year long. This is our first meeting back after holiday break, so I'm really excited to see everyone!

Be sure to tell your coworkers, friends, and neighbors about Norfolkjs and bring a buddy.

All skill levels are welcome! If you've ever been interested in web development, come on by.

#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective Hampton Roads | AI After Hours

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/312722493/)

**Description:**
**🤝 A social networking night for AI, automation, and curious minds**

AI After Dark is a relaxed, social-first networking event designed to bring together people across Hampton Roads who are curious about artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, vibecoding, and the future of technology.

This is not a lecture. This is not a pitch night.

It is a space to connect, explore ideas, and meet others who are building, learning, experimenting, or simply trying to understand where all of this is headed.

Whether you are brand new to AI or have been working in the field for years, you belong here.

**​✨ What to expect**

* Casual, open networking with a diverse mix of builders, creatives, technologists, founders, students, and professionals
* Organic conversations around AI, ML, automation, no-code, low-code, and emerging tools
* Light, informal discussion prompts to help break the ice
* No presentations, no panels, no pressure
* A welcoming environment for all experience levels and backgrounds

Come as you are. Grab a drink or coffee. Talk shop. Talk life. Make real connections.

**👥 Who should attend**
AI After Hours is for:

* People curious about AI and how it impacts work, creativity, and society
* Engineers, designers, product managers, analysts, and researchers
* No-code and automation builders
* Students and career switchers exploring the field
* Founders, consultants, and operators
* Seasoned professionals who want to meet others locally
* Anyone who wants to be part of Hampton Roads’ growing AI community

If you like thoughtful conversations and meeting people who care about where technology is going, you will fit right in.

**🏪 Supporting local businesses**
Each AI After Hours event is hosted at a local Hampton Roads business such as a brewery, coffee shop, or community space.

By attending, you are not only investing in your own network, you are also helping support the local venues that make our region vibrant. We intentionally rotate locations to spotlight different neighborhoods and businesses across the 757.

**💡 Why AI After Hours exists**
AI is moving fast. Community and connection help us move wisely.

AI After Hours exists to create a low-pressure, human-centered space where people can build relationships, share ideas, and learn from one another outside of formal talks or workshops. It is about strengthening the local ecosystem and making sure no one has to navigate this rapidly changing landscape alone.
