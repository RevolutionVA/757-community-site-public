**Description:**
**Post Quantum Cryptography in .NET 10**
Join us Tuesday, January 13th, as we dive into the cutting-edge world of post-quantum cryptography and what it means for .NET developers!

**Schedule**

* 5:45 PM — Doors open
* 6:00 PM — Food, drinks, and networking
* 6:30 PM — Presentation begins

**About This Session**
The security and cryptography folks spent the majority of their time in .NET 10's release working on post quantum cryptography. But what is it? In this session we're going to talk about why all of this work was done, what it means for you, and get an idea of what post quantum cryptography is actually for. We'll talk about the emerging problems in the field and how the software industry needs to adapt for the possible future of post quantum computing.

Whether you're deep into security or just curious about where cryptography is headed, this is a session you won't want to miss!

**Location**
Marathon Consulting (2nd Floor)
Plenty of free parking is available behind the building. If you're arriving later, the doors may be locked—check the sign on the door for instructions on how to get in.

#### Seminar: New Era of Defense Cybersecurity: Understanding CMMC 2.0

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/312701729/)

**Description:**
### (CS)²AI Online™ Seminar

**New Era of Defense Cybersecurity: Understanding CMMC 2.0**

The cybersecurity landscape for the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) is rapidly evolving—and **CMMC 2.0** is reshaping how organizations approach compliance, risk management, and cyber resilience.
In this (CS)²AI Online™ Seminar, subject matter experts break down the **intent, structure, and practical implications of CMMC 2.0**, helping organizations move beyond checkbox compliance toward meaningful security outcomes. Attendees will gain clarity on what has changed from previous versions, what requirements apply to their organization, and how to prepare effectively for assessments.

This session is designed for defense contractors, subcontractors, cybersecurity professionals, compliance leaders, and anyone responsible for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the defense ecosystem.

**Key topics include:**

* Overview of CMMC 2.0 and its streamlined model
* Understanding the three maturity levels and assessment requirements
* Alignment with NIST SP 800-171
* Common gaps and challenges organizations face
* Practical steps to prepare for CMMC assessments
* Training and workforce readiness considerations

Whether you’re just beginning your CMMC journey or refining an existing compliance strategy, this seminar provides actionable insights to help you navigate the **new era of defense cybersecurity** with confidence.

#### WSDG January Technical Presentation

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** The Williamsburg Software Developers Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/the-williamsburg-software-developers-group/events/312436860/)

**Description:**
Hexagonal and Screaming Architecture in .NET
by Brandon Atkinson

Abstract:
Hexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern designed to create loosely coupled application components that can seamlessly connect to their software environment using ports and adapters. This approach makes components interchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation, offering a robust alternative to the traditional layered architecture. In hexagonal architecture, each component communicates with others through well-defined "ports," following a specified interface to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.

Screaming architecture, a concept introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes that a software system’s structure should clearly communicate its purpose. Much like a building blueprint reveals the function of a structure, a well-designed software architecture should make its intent immediately apparent.

In this talk, we will briefly explore both hexagonal and screaming architecture patterns, then dive into code to see how these concepts can be applied to a modern .NET codebase. Additionally, we will discuss how these architectural principles can assist in planning and estimating work more effectively.

Bio:
Brandon Atkinson is a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field. He has authored books, been a Microsoft MVP (in SharePoint!), and holds a patent for CI/CD pipelines. He loves tinkering with code, and spends his time with his family in Richmond, VA.
