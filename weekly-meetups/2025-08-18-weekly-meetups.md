#### 757 AI Collective: Supercharge Your Coding with AI - A Hands-on Intro to Cursor

- **Time:** 05:30 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/757-artificial-intelligence/events/309098903/)

**Description:**
## Supercharge Your Coding with AI: A Hands-on Intro to Cursor

Ready to see how Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize your coding workflow? Join us for an interactive workshop on **Cursor**, the AI-powered IDE built for speed and efficiency. We'll go from setup to deploying a simple app and game, all while learning the powerful features that make Cursor a game-changer.
This session is all about practical, hands-on learning. We'll show you how to leverage AI to code faster, debug smarter, and manage your projects with ease.

***

### What We'll Cover 🚀

* **Meet Cursor:** We'll start with a tour of the Cursor interface, showing you how it combines the familiarity of VS Code with groundbreaking AI capabilities.
* **AI-Assisted Game Dev:** Together, we'll build a small, classic game (like Snake or Pong) from scratch. You'll see firsthand how Cursor's AI can generate code, suggest logic, and accelerate development.
* **Building a Simple App:** Next, we'll create a practical application, like a to-do list or a basic weather app, using AI to handle boilerplate code and implement features.
* **Mastering Your Workflow:** We'll show you how to connect Cursor to your **GitHub** account for seamless version control. You'll also learn how to use **Cursor's "Rules"** to provide custom context for the AI and get more accurate suggestions.
* **Learn to Prompt like a Pro:** We'll cover prompt engineering for complex projects and workflows and how to create a proper product requirement document and development checklist to keep track of each step.
* **Clone a Site with Firecrawl:** Lastly, we'll use Firecrawl MCP to clone nearly any website.
* **Q&A and Networking:** Got questions? We'll have plenty of time to answer them and for you to connect with other developers exploring the future of coding.

***

### Who Should Attend?

This meetup is for any anyone who wants to learn how to integrate AI into their coding process. Whether you're a student, a professional developer, vibe coder, or a hobbyist, you'll leave with practical skills you can apply to your own projects.

### What to Bring 💻

To follow along with the hands-on exercises, please bring a laptop with **Cursor** already installed. You can download it for free from [cursor.](https://cursor.sh/)com Also, please have a **GitHub** account created.
Come join us and discover how to build software faster and more intelligently than ever before!

**Navigating the Depths of OT Cybersecurity in Maritime and Naval Operations**

Join us for the next installment of the **(CS)²AI Online™ Symposium Series**, where we’ll dive into the critical and complex cyber security challenges facing the **Maritime and Naval domain**.

As vessels, ports, and naval operations become increasingly digitized and connected, operational technology (OT) systems are more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats. This symposium brings together top experts, strategists, and practitioners from government, military, and industry to explore real-world threats, emerging regulations, and best practices for securing mission-critical maritime systems.

Expect practical insights into:

* Unique OT cybersecurity risks in maritime and naval environments
* Threat intelligence and incident response strategies for sea-based operations
* Compliance with international maritime cyber standards
* Lessons learned from recent cyber incidents and naval exercises
* The intersection of national defense, logistics, and cyber resilience at sea

Whether you're in maritime operations, naval defense, port security, or OT cybersecurity, this session will equip you with timely knowledge and strategic foresight.

**Don’t miss this opportunity to connect, learn, and prepare for the future of maritime cyber defense.**
