## 6 Meetups This Week

### Tuesday, March 3

#### ISSA-HR Presents: AI Poisoning: LLM Data Poisoning 101

- **Time:** 05:30 PM
- **Group:** Information Systems Security Association ISSA Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/issa-hampton-roads/events/313489870/)

**Description:**
By Kenn Jensen
Visit our [Eventbrite Page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/issa-hr-presents-ai-poisoning-tickets-1983643092889) to **RSVP**

With over 35 years of professional experience in the IT domain, Kens background spans programming, database and web development, call center technology and consulting, emergency services management solutions, automation, as well as enterprise security web filtering and enterprise network discovery and monitoring. By day, Ken works as a senior infrastructure engineer. By night, OSINT for good and AI experimenting and red teaming.

This talk breaks down LLM data poisoning in plain English, explaining how attackers can intentionally introduce misleading or malicious data during training or fine-tuning so a model learns the wrong patterns. You’ll see how even small amounts of manipulated data can influence outputs, create blind spots, or quietly weaken the reliability of AI-driven tools that organizations depend on every day.
We’ll walk through the most common entry points where poisoning can occur, including third-party datasets, user-generated inputs, and automated data pipelines. The session will also highlight real-world implications for security teams, from trust erosion and decision risk to operational and compliance concerns. Attendees will leave with a practical understanding of the guardrails organizations use to reduce risk, including data validation practices, monitoring strategies, and governance approaches that help keep AI systems trustworthy and resilient.

https://events.zoom.us/ev/AtOaWF4tLEtLgjBW7B8ToC0vrZl6tjff3-qWtL9dID_MfRINcnQo\~AgS-SPGRhEzL6loLDYYK5OqiygGF6yxylhCIfBD0MQ6PDbFQ2DxcRG6geiK_5oX3o5ICx9Z-KpdmAbTFmF0Q9jKCJg

**Do you have cyber skills and want to make a real impact?**
If you’ve ever wondered how the private sector could be better leveraged during major cyber incidents—or how *you* could play a meaningful role—this event was built for you.
We are at a critical turning point. Incredible cyber capabilities exist across the private sector, government, and nonprofit communities, yet we still lack a unified framework to mobilize them effectively at scale. That changes now.

**Join us for a first‑of‑its‑kind experience focused on building a common Incident Command System (ICS) for cyber response through Civilian Reserve ISAC.**

At this event, you will:
· **Learn exactly how ICS can transform your cyber response approach**—and finally bridge the coordination gap between companies, government, and critical infrastructure partners.
· **Discover how to earn nationally recognized credentials**, preparing you to contribute confidently during real-world cyber incidents.
· **Engage directly with CR‑ISAC leadership**, the team building a nationwide civilian cyber reserve capable of supporting federal surge operations when it matters most.
· **Gain clarity, connection, and mission-ready skills** that allow you to step off the sidelines and into the arena.
If you're feeling the urgency to get trained, get involved, and stand ready to help your community and country during a major cyber event—**don’t miss this**.

**Be part of the movement to build cyber resilience. Your skills matter. Your participation matters. The time is now.**
