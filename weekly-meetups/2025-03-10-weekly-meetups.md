**Description:**
**IN PERSON ONLY. NO VIRTUAL OPTION. Come on out, network, and learn something!**

Join us for another great meeting! Come at 6pm to network and have conversations with fellow attendees. The meeting presentation starts around 6:15 pm.

**Abstract:**
.NET Aspire is far more than just a sleek dashboard for wowing your boss and co-workers. It's also a gateway to increased observability with open telemetry, better fault tolerance to fend off chaos monkeys, and a drastically improved onboarding experience for new developers.
This session will explore Microsoft's latest guidance for building distributed, cloud-first applications, with practical strategies for enhancing simpler existing apps. You'll discover the inner workings of Aspire, from installation to customization, and learn how it streamlines integration with performance boosters like Redis. Most importantly, you'll see why scalable microservices architectures can be challenging—and how Aspire helps simplify the journey.
