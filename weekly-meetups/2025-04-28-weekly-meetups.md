**Description:**
### Stopping Exploits That Can Kill - Analysis of 5 Years After A Medical Device Cybersecurity Recall

Over five years ago, the FDA initiated one of the first medical device recalls due to cybersecurity. How did such a recall happen, and what has happened since the recall? What can we learn about the approach used by the FDA, and could a similar approach be used for other industries?

Join us as we explored the various stages of the recall and the impact of the recall on the medical device industry. We’ll describe some things other industries might be able to use.
