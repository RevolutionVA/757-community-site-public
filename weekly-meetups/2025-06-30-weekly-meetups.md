#### Thriving with Careers: Exciting Updates to BUiLT Events and Membership

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/308630324/)

**Description:**
**AI is eliminating jobs and transforming most of the rest.** And what about us humans? An MIT study raises concerns that AI tools may hinder critical thinking and promote passive acceptance of algorithm-driven content.

Have you heard ... BUiLT is pivoting to 1) ensure you stay relevant in your careers, 2) that you find great career opportunities, and 3) that you find the best talent for your teams.

Meet and hear the BUiLT leadership team's plans on:

* Upcoming training and certification program on enhancing our human skills to stay ahead of AI job elimination
* Badging and credential programs
* Where to find BUiLT's events
* Local programming for your area

We'll have a 30-minute presentation and then open the floor.

Ask us anything about how we are pivoting to meet your needs.

**Remaining Human**
Strategic, creative, and supervisory positions are more resistant to AI-driven elimination because they rely on human judgment, emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and innovation‚Äîareas where AI still struggles or lacks the flexibility and trust needed.
To thrive in an AI-driven tech workforce, professionals must enroll in programs to enhance ‚Äúuniquely human‚Äù competencies, trainable through targeted learning.

### Sunday, July 6

#### Get in tech with Scrum

- **Time:** 02:30 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307673386/)

**Description:**
Join this 1-hour technical primer on What is a Scrum Master.

A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team to manage the flow of information between team members. A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.

People who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.

Salaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

**The course is open to the public.**
