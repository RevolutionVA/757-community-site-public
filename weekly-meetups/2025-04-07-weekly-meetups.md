#### (CS)²AI REPLAY:Why Organizations Struggle to get OT Visibility & Detection Right

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/306959710/)

**Description:**
***Tales From the Trenches – Why Organizations Struggle to get OT Visibility & Detection Right***

Whether it’s due to increasing awareness or due to Board/Compliance requirements, most OT Security programs start with a preliminary risk assessment. One of the initial steps is to get a list of OT assets, which used to be a rudimentary spreadsheet exercise. With the wide availability of passive OT asset discovery tools, many go down that path via a Proof of Concept to generate Asset Inventory.

This talk focused on lessons learnt from the trenches performing the proof of concepts and covers challenges including availability of infrastructure (span ports/tap, routing, bandwidth), archaic protocol implementations, organizational policies for network flows, risk appetite for active probing on low traffic networks, OT & IT personnel knowledge of each other’s domains, and finally budgeting.

#### Get in tech with Scrum

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307150498/)

**Description:**
Join this 1-hour technical primer on What is a Scrum Master.

A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team to manage the flow of information between team members. A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.

People who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.

Salaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

**The course is open to the public.**
