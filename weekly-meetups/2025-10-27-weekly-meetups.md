**Description:**
State of Vue.js in 2025 with Aleksandr Podyachev -
"[Vue.js](http://vue.js/) is a new JavaScript framework that is a rising star among JavaScript frameworks. [Vue.js](http://vue.js/) was invented by Evan You as a simple JavaScript framework because he wanted a more lightweight version of AngularJS. The idea behind it is that it is a middle ground between React and Angular, with Angular being heavier and React being lighter. The purpose is that you have the option to use more advanced features if you want to, but you don't need to have them. The other notable thing is that it is maintained by Evan You and the Vue community, as opposed to React being maintained by Facebook and Angular being maintained by Google."

All skill levels are welcome! If you've ever been interested in web development, come on by.

As always, HUGE thanks to Assembly for hosting.‚Ä®Learn more about the amenities and community of Assembly at [https://www.assemblynfk.com/](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)

Street parking is free after 6 pm. From 6:30-7:00 pm, we will have someone at the door to let you in. After 7, message the #javascript channel on 757Dev Slack. We meet in the Fur Room on the 4th floor.

#### üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The AI Collective HR ‚Ä¢ A Community Town Hall on Navigating the Age of AGI

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/310091445/)

**Description:**
**Event title:** Our Final Invention: A Community Town Hall on Navigating the Age of AGI

**Event description:**
The smartest people in the room are getting scared. Geoffrey Hinton, the "Godfather of AI," left Google specifically to warn us about the technology he helped create. Top researchers now predict that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)‚ÄîAI with human-level cognitive abilities‚Äîcould arrive between 2027 and 2030.

What happens when we are no longer the smartest beings on the planet?

This isn't just about a "bigger ChatGPT". We're on the verge of a technology that can learn, reason, and solve novel problems on its own ‚Äîan intellect that could eventually become vastly smarter than the best human brains in every field. The leap could be as significant as the one between a housefly and Einstein.

The stakes couldn't be higher. An aligned AGI could help us cure all diseases and end poverty. A misaligned one could lead to scenarios like an eternal AI dictatorship or even extermination by indifference.

The time to talk about this is not when it happens. It's right now.

Join us for a community town hall to tackle the most important questions of our time. This is not a lecture; it's a moderated, interactive discussion where your voice is crucial. We will explore:

* **Our community's role:** Given the global nature of the AGI race, what meaningful role can a local tech community like ours play in promoting AI safety?
* **Defining our values:** What core human values (like compassion or fairness) should we demand be embedded into these systems before they become too powerful to control?
* **Preparing for disruption:** How do we prepare our local economy and workforce for the massive, inevitable disruption AGI will cause to almost every job?
* **The global pause dilemma:** Should a company on the verge of AGI be required to pause and collaborate globally, or is that a naive hope in a high-stakes competitive race?
* **A call to action:** What is the single most important action‚Äîpersonal, professional, or political‚Äîthat you can take *this year* to positively influence the outcome?

***

**Who should attend?**
This conversation is for everyone: tech professionals, entrepreneurs, policymakers, students, and any concerned citizen who wants to understand and shape the future of humanity in the age of intelligent machines.

***

**About the moderators**
This town hall will be moderated by **Andrew Stafford** and **Lionel Sapp**.

Andrew is a founding member and a director for The AI Collective Hampton Roads and cofounder of the AI startup Your AI Group. With 24 years in tech, including roles at Amazon, NASA, and multiple startups, he is an author of 11 books and a board advisor with deep experience in building and deploying advanced technology.
