Join the **premier event for OT cyber security professionals**, where engineering meets cyber security to protect critical infrastructure.

The **Level Zero Conference** brings experts from across industries together to address the complex challenges of securing operational technology. Our multidisciplinary approach integrates engineering, cyber security, and risk management to safeguard critical infrastructure from level zero to the cloud.

IT and OT have traditionally operated in silos, with each team lacking a critical understanding of the other. The Level Zero Conference bridges this divide by bringing together experts from OT and IT – engineering, operations, and cyber security.

Fostering collaboration and cross-disciplinary understanding are both essential for the protection of critical infrastructure. Through the exchange of ideas and expertise, Level Zero empowers professionals from different domains to develop a deeper understanding of both IT and OT environments enabling the creation of infrastructure that is integrated and resilient to evolving threats.

**Level Zero Conference** is where the future of OT cyber security is shaped. **Don’t miss this opportunity to contribute to and learn from the industry’s leading minds.**

Like many others, Black people are resilient in solving problems and living lives fraught with obstacles and setbacks. Black tech professionals are no different, and their ability to solve problems in life makes them uniquely qualified to solve some of the toughest business problems.

The research is in that minorities who live in majority communities often have advantages in the workforce of:

· Adaptability & Resilience
· Stronger Problem-Solving & Creativity
· Cross-Cultural Communication & Collaboration
· High Emotional Intelligence & Empathy
· Comfort with Change & Uncertainty
· Conflict Resolution & Mediation Skills
· Awareness of Bias & Inclusion Strategies

In the Truth About Black Tech Overcomers series, we discuss the situation and techniques some Black Technologists have employed to remain upbeat during extended job searches.

Employers, if you want to get added exposure and recognition for the impact you provide, you can participate as a sponsor. [https://builtinternational.org/built-truth-about/](https://builtinternational.org/built-truth-about/)

Attend to be inspired and learn each week as we highlight the careers and successes of two Black tech job seekers who are overcoming or have overcome, each and every day.

**Also, if you'd like to be featured in the series, let us know @ info@builtintl.org.** Also, if you have succeeded in obtaining a job after an extended transition of 6 months or more, let us know, too.
