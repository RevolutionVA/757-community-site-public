#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective HR • AI for Startups

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/311108300/)

**Description:**
# **The AI-native startup - Scaling without headcount**

​**How founders are achieving 10x output with tiny teams — and how you can too.**

​Startups today look nothing like startups from five years ago. With AI as the new force multiplier, small teams are building faster, operating leaner, and scaling without adding headcount. This session breaks down the *practical tools, workflows, and strategies* that modern founders are using to turn themselves into AI-powered organizations.

​Join **Andrew Stafford** and **Charlie O’Brien** for a tactical walkthrough designed for founders, builders, creators, and operators.

# ​**🔍 What You’ll Learn**

​**The new unit of startup economics**
Why 1 person + AI now equals the output of a traditional 10-person team.

​**The 30-second skill every founder needs: Real prompt engineering**
Use the R.C.T.F. framework (Role, Context, Task, Format) to turn AI into a reliable digital employee.

​**Coding for everyone — from no-code to advanced devs**
How tools like **Lovable**, **[Vly.ai](http://vly.ai/)**, **Cursor**, and **Copilot** cut build time by 30–50%.

​**Marketing & content workflows that actually work**
Research with **Perplexity**, branding with **Midjourney/Ideogram**, SEO with **Claude**, and lead enrichment with **Clay + Smartlead**.

​**Automation & agents: The next frontier**
How “AI staff” can schedule tasks, update CRMs, analyze emails, build components, and execute multi-step workflows autonomously.

​**Guardrails & best practices**
Avoid hallucinations, protect your data, and keep your content authentic.
​You’ll leave with a **Monday Morning Checklist** — a simple, practical set of actions to start automating your business this week.

# ​**🎙️ Your Speakers**

## ​**Andrew Stafford**

​Co-Lead of The AI Collective Hampton Roads chapter.
​25 years across two startups, Amazon, NASA, and major enterprise consulting.

## ​**Charlie O’Brien**

​Founder of LOGENTIQ • Sr. Product & Operations Manager at 757 Collab.
​Helps founders turn unclear goals into clear, delegate-ready AI action plans.

# ​**Who should attend?**

​Founders
​Small business owners
​Startup teams
​Developers & no-coders
​Anyone wanting to scale without adding overhead

# ​**Why this matters**

​We are in a moment similar to the invention of the camera:
​the basic work — emails, code, research, admin — has become cheap and fast.
​Your value now is your *taste*, your *strategy*, and your ability to orchestrate AI tools.
​This event shows you exactly how to do that.
