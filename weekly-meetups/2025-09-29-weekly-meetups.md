#### Git On The Trail: A Workshop on Version Control Basics presented by Tim Baines

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** Norfolk.js
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolkjs/events/310713880/)

**Description:**
"As an aspiring frontend developer, this is my first time teaching Git, and I'm excited to share this workshop based on my continuing learning journey.

Having recently hiked the Highline Trail at Glacier National Park for the second time, I discovered that the parallels between trail navigation and Git workflows make for a relatable learning experience. We'll navigate the basics using hiking narratives such as checkpoints, decision points, and progress tracking, just like Git.

I'm not a serious hiker, but I am passionate about growth and sharing what I'm learning in hopes of helping others excel."

All skill levels are welcome! If you've ever been interested in web development, come on by.

As always, HUGE thanks to Assembly for hosting.‚Ä®Learn more about the amenities and community of Assembly at [https://www.assemblynfk.com/](https://www.assemblynfk.com/)
