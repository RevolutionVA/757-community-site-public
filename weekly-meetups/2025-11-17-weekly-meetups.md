# (CS)²AI Online™ Symposium: ICS/OT Cybersecurity Standards & Regulations

Navigating the evolving landscape of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and regulations for industrial control systems (ICS and operating technology (OT) presents a burgeoning challenge. Even top-tier organizations and seasoned professionals may require assistance in determining the applicable ones based on factors like location, industry categories, criticalities, supply chain roles, customer profiles, among others. Understanding which standards are obligatory, recommended, or simply beneficial, as well as assessing the true costs of implementation and compliance, is crucial. Managing conflicting priorities due to overlapping regulations and standards necessitates expertise and practical insights.

Join us on Wednesday, November 19, for a **(CS)²AI Online™ Symposium** delving into these crucial questions and considerations. We're privileged to host founders, visionaries, and esteemed committee members behind leading standards and regulations, offering profound insights. Following plenary sessions, seize the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions in breakout rooms with these experts, allowing you to pose direct queries.

#### 🧜‍♀️ The AI Collective HR • AI, Medicine, and Me

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** 757 Artificial Intelligence Collective
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/aicollectivehr/events/311108259/)

**Description:**
**Medical knowledge now doubles every 73 days, creating a gap doctors can't bridge alone. What if you could use new AI tools to help find the answers?**

Are you, or a loved one, navigating a complex health journey? The old model of "doctor's orders" is being replaced by a new "patient as partner" model—and AI is the tool that makes it possible.

Join technologist Andrew Stafford and EVMS physician-researcher Atiq Bhatti, MD, for a groundbreaking 60-minute talk.

**What you'll learn**

* How to safely use tools like ChatGPT and Gemini for your own health research.
* The "trust barrier" that keeps doctors from using AI—and how it's being solved.
* A look at the new, doctor-specific AI tools like **Open Evidence** and **UpToDate Expert AI** that are changing medicine right now.
* How patients, nurses, and small practice owners—not just giant hospitals—are at the center of this revolution.

This talk is for empowered patients, healthcare staff (NPs/nurses), small practice owners, and anyone curious about the future of medicine.

​​We look forward to seeing you there and building a vibrant AI community in the 757 area!
