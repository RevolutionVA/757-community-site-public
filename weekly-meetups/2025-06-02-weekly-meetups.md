- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/308135195/)

**Description:**
# Robots, Rails, Bytes and Risk

Robotic warehousing may not be the first thing we think of when discussing industrial control systems. However, modern automated warehousing is a myriad of different IT and OT technologies that combine to create a robust business solution at an immense scale. In this case study discussion, cyber security veteran Brent Huston will discuss how information security frameworks, technical analysis, machine learning and proper application of risk management techniques led to a successful implementation.

We’ll discuss how the project unfolded, some of the significant challenges and lessons learned. We’ll also discuss what it sounds like when robots smash into each other at high speeds and how difficult root cause analysis can be in a complex environment.
