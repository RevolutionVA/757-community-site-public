#### DOUBLE MEETING! Join us of Rob Sewell & Traci Sewell. Details Below

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads SQL Server User Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/hampton-roads-sql-server-user-group/events/307919018/)

**Description:**
**DOUBLE MEETING!!!!!**

**Rob Sewell** -
**Commits - What's the point? Tips for data professionals**
Committing code is an integral part of the development lifecycle. However, not all commits
or commit messages are created equal. As more data professionals are required or expected to use source control within a continuous integration or deployment solution, a lack of good information is reducing the efficacy and usefulness of commit messages.
In this session we will explore the source control system git, what makes a commit and what a commit message is for.
We will also learn what makes a good, and a bad, commit message and how to automatically link commit messages to User Stories and release notes.

**Traci Sewell**

**When the firehose causes the burnout**
**How Do we create a firebreak?**

Burnout is complex, and as it is unique to every person, it can be difficult to define and identify. Let me help you with that.
Over the past few years burnout has become commonly mentioned in conversations about work life balance, about work from home, about hybrid working, about returning to the office.
As is often the case when a newer issue becomes a commonly used buzzword, it's true definition and potential causes have become watered down. Even the description of the recognized symptoms, prevention and treatments has become diluted. The realities of dealing with burnout, both in the workplace and in our personal lives, have been lost in the smoke.
In this session we will be reminded of what burnout actually looks like, how it is correctly defined, and how we can avoid some of the triggers.
I will share my professional experiences with a variety of different symptoms and issues and introduce you to some of the approaches that I encourage people to use.
You will leave this session having added tools to your toolbox that are relatively straightforward, hopefully memorable, and generic enough that they will apply to the majority of us.
