#### REPLAY: Case Study - Danish Critical Infrastructure Attack

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/308690401/)

**Description:**
In May 2023, 22 companies operating parts of the Danish energy infrastructure were compromised in a coordinated attack. Michael Weng will present details of this attack, including the timeline of attack discovery, steps taken in response by defenders, resolution, and the lessons learned from the incident. He will explain the perspective of the Danish CERT, highlighted through the report released in November 2023.

Michael also describes why an OT/ICS NSM solution would not have detected this attack, hence wouldn't have made a significant difference for the defense of the OT/ICS environments.

#### WSDG July Technical Presentation

- **Time:** 06:30 PM
- **Group:** The Williamsburg Software Developers Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/the-williamsburg-software-developers-group/events/308460435/)

**Description:**
Title: Groovy for fun and profit
by Sujith Paul

Abstract: Java has a (perhaps unfair) reputation of being a rigid, verbose and conservative programming language. After all, it doesn’t seem well suited to writing scripts, experimenting with new APIs, spinning up a quick proof of concept or creating expressive Domain-Specific Languages. That is exactly the space where Groovy excels. Inspired by Python, Ruby and SmallTalk, Groovy is a multi-faceted language for the JVM that aims to provide a Java-like feel and syntax, but with added productivity features.

In this talk we will go over some of those powerful features of Groovy. We will also explore practical ways of using Groovy to improve your developer experience in your day to day work. Whether you are an experienced Java developer or complete newbie, I am sure you will find a few valuable takeaways from this session.

Bio: Sujith Paul is a Lead Consultant at Terazo, responsible for the architecture, design and delivery of software solutions on client engagements. His preferred tools of the trade are Java, Spring, Go, AWS, Docker and Terraform. His previous experience includes cloud migration, modernizing enterprise applications and agile transformations. He values craftsmanship, robustness and minimalism.

Away from the computer, Sujith enjoys live music, craft beer and being out in the nature walking or biking.

#### Get in tech with Scrum

- **Time:** 07:00 PM
- **Group:** Blacks United in Leading Technology - Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/blacks-united-in-leading-technology-hampton-roads/events/307673386/)

**Description:**
Join this 1-hour technical primer on What is a Scrum Master.

A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team to manage the flow of information between team members. A Scrum Master helps streamline project processes to achieve goals faster.

People who have strong interpersonal skills like empathy and active listening are core skills to building positive relationships with others. A Scrum Master must effectively facilitate meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives) to ensure they are productive and stay on track. A scrum master is supposed to be an experienced negotiator and facilitator to handle disagreements and find a satisfactory solution for everyone involved.

Salaries as Scrum Master often range from $106,000 - $120,000. There's a huge demand for Scrum Masters who can help departments increase the efficiency of teams, and help organizations respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

**The course is open to the public.**
