#### Cybersecurity: Ungatekeeping RFID - Demystifying the tech

- **Time:** 05:30 PM
- **Group:** Information Systems Security Association ISSA Hampton Roads
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/issa-hampton-roads/events/305690156/)

**Description:**
RFID is everywhereâ€”yet few understand it. From toy tags to access cards and even passports, RFID is part of our daily lives. Unfortunately, that also makes it a popular target for attackers who know how to exploit its weaknesses.
In this talk, Erich Jackson will lift the veil on RFID by showing how the technology works, how hackers clone and spoof RFID signals, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”what security professionals can do to protect against these threats. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge they can use to better understand, evaluate, and secure the RFID-enabled assets around them. Whether you're new to RFID or want a deeper technical edge, this presentation will give you the tools to move from passive user to informed defender.

Speaker:
Erich Jackson is a Pentest Architect at a Fortune 500 company and the founder of Halberd Security. He has spoken at conferences including HackRedCon, ISSA DC & Louisville, the DRI Trucking Law Conference, and Nerd Nite Louisville. Erich contributes to the security community through his open-source library work and holds a U.S. patent in automatic foreign language translation. He holds numerous advanced certifications including GXPN, GWAPT, GPEN, GCSA, and GCIH from SANS.
His current research focuses on offensive security, physical access systems, and bridging the gap between hardware and network exploitation.

### Wednesday, September 10

#### (CS)Â²AI Fellow Fireside Chat: Building OT Capacity for IR and Pentesting

- **Time:** 01:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Cyber Security for Control Systems
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/norfolk-cyber-security-for-control-systems/events/310761479/)

**Description:**
Operational Technology (OT) environments face unique challenges when it comes to incident response (IR) and penetration testing. As cyber threats continue to evolve, organizations must strengthen their capacity to prepare, detect, and respond effectively to incidentsâ€”while also proactively testing defenses to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do.

Join us for this **live and interactive seminar** where leading experts will explore strategies, best practices, and lessons learned for building OT-specific capabilities in both IR and pentesting. Participants will gain actionable insights into:

* Tailoring IR processes for OT systems
* Overcoming common pitfalls in OT pentesting
* Strengthening team skills and capacity to meet todayâ€™s threat landscape
* Leveraging industry tools and frameworks to build resilience

This session will equip practitioners, defenders, and decision-makers with the knowledge needed to enhance security postures across critical infrastructure.

Git Commitizenship
by Timothy Stone

Abstract:
Git commit message discipline is hard. Maybe seems hard...? From XKCD 1296 to WhatTheCommit.com, something is "true" about the jokes.

What if there was a standard and a way to nudge, even enforce, better commit messages in your daily work and the work of your colleagues? We'll look at the reality of Git commits, the friction to better commits, and the tools and processes that can help you and your colleagues earn their Good Commitizenship merit badges.

Bio:
Tim is a father, blogger, OSS committer, source control nerd, Java certified web developer, analog wargamer, home brewer, and lifelong RPG gamer. With 25+ years in Software Development and Solution Architecture at Scale for Consumer Credit and E&S Insurance, Tim enjoys sharing with the community and mentoring.
