Whether it's the pacemaker in your chest or the gas distribution control system in your hospital, medical devices and healthcare systems are the most clearly designed and used to protect human lives. Tens of millions of us depend on their uninterrupted operations every day.

**Join us to learn what is happening in this field.**

*\- Are medical devices and healthcare \(and building control\) systems being designed with cybersecurity in mind?*

*\- How much of what's out there is still legacy\, with no cybersecurity at all?*
*\- What regulations are relevant here?*
