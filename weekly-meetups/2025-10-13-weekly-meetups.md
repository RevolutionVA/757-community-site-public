#### Stop Writing Acceptance Tests! Automating E2E Testing with Skyvern and AZ OpenAI

- **Time:** 06:00 PM
- **Group:** Hampton Roads Azure Users Group
- **Link:** [Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/hampton-roads-azure-users-group/events/309734620/)

**Description:**
E2E tests, regression tests, or acceptance tests, no matter what you call them, generally involve manual testing, or writing a suite of automated tests that can become brittle over time and require a lot of maintenance. But what if it didn't need to be this way. What if we could just write some plain english tests that simply state what we want to test, and not worry about page structure, XPaths, etc. We can!

In this talk we'll look at using an open-source project called Skyvern, coupled with Azure OpenAI to run automated E2E tests only using natural language prompts. Skyvern automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. Combined with the ease of Azure OpenAI, we can quickly build automated testing solutions that can give time back to engineers, and make testing easier and more complete.

We'll take a look at the parts of this solution, and walk through a simple build that can test any website and report back on its findings.
