## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## JSON Data Validation

This project uses JSON Schema validation to ensure data integrity. The validation is performed in two ways:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Automatically validates JSON files against their schemas on push and pull requests.
2. **Local Validation**: You can validate JSON files locally using the following command:

```bash
npm run validate
```

### Setting up Git Hooks (Optional)

To automatically validate JSON files before each commit, you can set up a pre-commit hook:

1. Install husky:
```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky install
```

2. Add the pre-commit hook:
```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run validate"
```

This will prevent commits if the JSON files don't conform to their schemas.

### JSON Schemas

The JSON schemas are located in the `src/data/schemas` directory:

- `conferences.schema.json`: Schema for conference data
- `meetups.schema.json`: Schema for meetup data

When adding or modifying data in the JSON files, make sure they conform to these schemas.
