        <h3>Working Remotely from Hampton Roads</h3>
        <p>
          Hampton Roads is a great place to work remotely! With a lower cost of living than major tech hubs, 
          beautiful beaches, and a growing tech community, it's an ideal location for remote workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out local coworking spaces like <a href="#">757 Coworking</a> and <a href="#">Percolator</a> 
          to connect with other remote workers in the area.
