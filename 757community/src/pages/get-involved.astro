        <h2>Join a Meetup</h2>
        <p>
          One of the easiest ways to get involved is to join a local meetup group. Check out our 
          <a href="/meetups">Meetups page</a> for a list of active groups in the area. Attend events, 
          network with other professionals, and learn new skills.

        <h2>Join Online Communities</h2>
        <p>
          Can't make it to in-person events? Join one of the many online communities for tech professionals 
          in Hampton Roads. The <a href="https://757dev.org">757dev Slack</a> is a great place to start.

        <h2>Speak at a Meetup</h2>
        <p>
          Have knowledge to share? Consider speaking at a local meetup. Most groups are always looking for speakers, 
          and it's a great way to build your personal brand and give back to the community.
        </p>

      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Organize an Event</h2>
        <p>
          If you see a gap in the community, consider organizing your own event. It could be a small workshop, 
          a conference, or even a new regular meetup group. The community will support you!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Not sure if there's enough interest in your topic? Consider reaching out to 
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/757dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">757 Developers on Meetup</a> 
          to host a session first. It's a great way to test your topic and gauge interest before committing to starting 
          your own meetup group.

      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>
          Many tech events in the area need volunteers. It's a great way to meet people and contribute to the community.

        <h2>Mentor Others</h2>
        <p>
          Share your knowledge and experience by mentoring others. This could be through formal programs or 
          just by being available to answer questions and provide guidance to those who are just starting out.
